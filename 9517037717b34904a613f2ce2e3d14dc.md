This compilation is not copyrighted or protected in any way by the
editor of the compilation (Leo Brodie). It is based on a series of
un-copyrighted class notes written by animation instructor Walt
Stanchfield during the period roughly from 1970 to 1990. Since then,
these class handouts have been widely copied and shared amongst
animation students and members of the animation industry with Mr.
Stanchfield\'s blessing and encouragement; in that spirit, the handouts
are now available freely on the Internet. Some of the illustrations in
this book represent preliminary drawings of cartoon characters that are
the properties of their respective copyright holder(s) and are therefore
protected by copyright. These illustrations were part of the original
handouts and are included here for educational purposes to illustrate
specific principles of animation technique. No endorsement of this book
by the copyright holder(s) is implied, nor do the views expressed in
this book necessary reflect those of the copyright holders(s). I hope
that covers it.

> **Foreword by the Editor**\
> Walt Stanchfield was an animator who taught life drawing classes for
> animators with a special emphasis on gesture drawing. For each weekly
> class session, he wrote informal handouts to emphasize the theme of
> the current class session, to comment on work done in the previous
> class, or discuss whatever topic struck his fancy. Over a period of
> years, these notes were lovingly shared, studied, and treasured by
> animators and animation students everywhere.

> Mr. Stanchfield personally gave copies of his collection to interested

> them as a book, but the studio where he worked was not interested.

> Stanchfield did not present his topics in any particular order, which

originally presented. I\'ve left \"Savvy Sayings\" (\#47 in the
animationmeat.com collection) out of this book, so it remains a delight
that you can seek out on your own.

Many, many thanks to Jon Hooper and Steve Kellener of AnimationMeat.com
for scanning and transcribing many of Walt\'s notes and making them
available on their Web site. This book incorporates their scans and OCR
conversions, so it would not exist without their efforts. Thanks also to
Aimee Major Steinberger, who was, I believe, the first person to post
one of the Walt\'s notes on the Internet.

viii Walt Stanchfield

**From the October 2000 Peg-Board**\
Once in a lifetime, a truly special teacher comes along who can change
your life forever. To me and to many, many of our colleagues in the
industry, Walt Stanchfield was that very special teacher.

> Part artist, part poet, part musician, part tennis pro, part eccentric
> savant, part wizened professor, Walt inspired a generation of young
> artists not only with his vast understanding of the animator\'s craft,
> but with his enthusiasm and love of life.
>
> Walt started in the animation industry at Mintz in 1937. He also
> worked for two years at Lantz. In 1948 he went to work for Disney and
> with the exception of four short retirements, had worked there ever
> since. Walt worked on every full-length cartoon feature from The
> Adventures of Ichabod Crane and Mr. Toad (1949) to The Great Mouse
> Detective (1986).
>
> Throughout those years Walt developed an insatiable enthusiasm for
> teaching the craft. He supported his numerous drawing classes with
> weekly hand-outs that taught not only animation and drawing
> principles, but philosophy, attitude and life lessons.
>
> Walt\'s personal work was full of vitality. He was a tireless
> sketcher, a painter of landscapes, seascapes, still lifes and people.
> He was an avid writer, penning hundreds of pages of notes about the
> art of animation as well as poetry and stories. He also loved music
> and spent an inordinate amount of time at the piano - that is, between
> caring for his vegetable garden and playing his most beloved game:
> tennis.
>
> Walt has touched many lives, not only with his endless enthusiasm for
> animation but with his love of life, art and people. His work will
> live on forever in the hands and hearts of his students and we will
> all miss him.

that lead the way and accomplish the \"academy-award-worthy\" animation
and drawing. But it is my conviction that by earnest pursuit, anyone can
be of that group. It\'s just a matter of exposing oneself to some
vehicle that will help one break the \"sound barrier\" (actually,
thought barrier, for drawing is a thinking person\'s art).

Here\'s a caricature by Dan Haskett that captured the spirit of my
\"Teaching\" many years ago at the \"Disney School of Animation\". It\'s
quite a prophetic drawing too, for out in the audience are two of your
current directors - Clements and Musker. Spot any others?

Maybe Jerry Reeves? Ed Gombert? Bluth, Pomeroy and Goldman? Even the
artist himself is there - Dan Haskett.

Different faces out there now but the sentiments are the same.

In the *Illusion Of Life*, Ollie or Frank had written a paragraph on
cleanup people which lists some of the functions of a cleanup person
which coincide with some of the things I keep stressing in the drawing
class: a crisp line against a soft shape (using angles), designing
shapes that work with the action rather than copying, emphasizing squash
and stretch, and drawing detail only as it furthers the action and the
drawing. Especially, "telling the story" whether it's a scene of
animation or a still drawing.

**Give Them the Experience**\
Drawing for animation is not just copying a model onto paper; you could
do that better with a camera. Drawing for animation is translating an
action into drawing form so an audience can retranslate those drawings
back into an experience of that action. You don't just want to show the
audience an action for them to look at it. You want to visualize an
action for them to see -- that is, to experience. That way you have them
in your grasp, your power, and then the story can go on and the audience
goes on with it, because they are involved. You have allowed them to
experience it.

The parts of the figure must be put together in a manner that will
portray or caricature the meaning of the pose. Otherwise it will be just
a drawing. What a horrible fate -- to be just a drawing.

Here are some animation drawings that have transcended the anatomy and
model of the characters. They are good drawings, but not just drawings.

**The Driving Force behind the Action**\
In drawing sessions, I try to direct the students\' thoughts to the
gesture rather than to the physical presence of the models and their
sartorial trappings. It seems the less the model wears, the more the
thinking is directed to anatomy, while the more the model wears, the
more the thinking goes into drawing the costume. It's a deadlock that
you can only break by shifting mental gears from the "secondary"
(details) to the "primary" (motive or driving force behind the pose).
Remember, the drawing you are doing in class should be thought of as a
refining process for your animation drawing skills.

I found something in Eric Larson's first lecture on Entertainment, which
may be of help to you. Please bear with the length of the quote; it is
put so well I couldn't edit it without losing some of the meaning. As
you read it, keep your mind on gesture drawing.

**Go For The Truth!**

We actually create nothing of our ourselves---we merely use the creative
force that activates us. And when we draw we are not using the left
brain to record facts, we have shifted gears and are now using the right
brain to create a little one picture story. With, of course, the facts
that the left brain collected and named and itemized in former study
periods. This is not a study period; this is a show and tell period
(time we are not studying).

Do you feel that you are too limited in knowledge? Robert Henri, that
great teacher of art said that anyone could paint a masterpiece with
what limited knowledge they have. It would be a matter of using that
limited knowledge in the right (creative) way. Have you ever seen the
\"knowledge\" or drawing ability of that great painter Albert Ryder?
Probably not. But when you look at his nebulous paintings of ships at
sea or skeletons riding around with nothing on, you sense the drama and
have a feeling a story in being told. If its facts you want, pick up a
Sears mail order catalogue.

I\'m not advocating abandoning the study of the figure. Anatomy is a
vital tool in drawing---but don\'t mesmerize yourself into thinking that
knowing the figure is going to make an artist of you. What is going to
make an artist out of you is a combination of a few basic facts about
the body, a few basic principles of drawing and an extensive, obsessive
desire and urge to express your feelings and impressions.

Yehudi Menuin, the violinist started out at the \"top\" of his
profession. He played in concerts at a very young age and in his late
teens was world famous. Suddenly (if late teens is sudden) he realized
he\'d never taken a lesson---he didn\'t know how he was playing the
violin (the right brain hadn\'t been discovered then).

He worried that if that inspired way of playing ever left him, he\'d not
be able to play. So he took lessons and learned music (finally getting
the left brain into the art). It didn\'t alter his playing ability but
it bought him some insurance.

I\'m suggesting that somehow he had early on tapped the creative force
and bypassed the ponderous study period, like all geniuses seem to do. I
have a Mozart piano piece that he wrote when he was around 9 years old.
I\'ve been working on it for years and still can\'t play it. Who does he
think he is anyway? I\'ve been studying piano for umpteen years and I
still don\'t know the key signatures. The left side of the brain is
absolutely numb. But when I set down to play the piano, sometimes that
creative force takes my hands and extracts a hint of emotional sound out
of the music. That\'s all I really care about.

My sketching is the same way. I don\'t know a scapula from a sternum but
when I venture out into the world with my sketch book, I am able to
distill my impressions into a oneframe story that totally tells my
version of what I saw. When my wife Dee and I go on a vacation, she
takes the photos and I sketch. She records the facts---I record the
truth.

Shift gears! With the few facts you have---go for the truth!

Carry a sketch book---a cheap one so you won\'t worry about wasting a
page. Sketch in the underground, while watching television, in pubs, at
horse shows. Sports events are especially fun to sketch--- boxing
matches, football games, etc. Draw constantly. Interest in life will
grow. Ability to solve drawing problems will be sharpened. Creative
juices will surge. Healing fluids will flow throughout your body. An
eagerness for life and experience and growth will crowd out all feelings
of ennui and disinterest.

Where are you going to get all this energy, you ask? Realize that the
human body is like a dynamo, it is an energy producing machine. The more
you use up its energy, the more it produces. A work-related pastime like
sketching is a positive activity. Inactivity,\
especially in your chosen field, is a negative. Negativity is heavy,
cumbersome,\
debilitating, unproductive and totally to be avoided. Take a positive
step today. Buy a sketch book and a pen (more permanent than pencil),
make a little rectangle on the page and fill it with a simple
composition.

trucks---all doing their own thing. They\'re as different from each
other as a farmer is from an office worker; or a military man is from a
hobo. Don\'t sketch vehicles as if you were doing a Ford ad --- go for
their personalities, their gesture. Sketching can not only be fun, but
it will help you master those blank sheets of paper you\'re going to be
spending the rest of your life battling.

**Composition**\
First draw a rectangle and work within that to force yourself to make a
composition, relating one thing to another and to the borders. If you
feel a need for toning the sketches, use cross hatch or carry a couple
of gray felt tip pens. Get in the habit of using a pen. It is much more
direct and does not rub off like a soft pencil.

I have Xeroxed some sketches I made at the airport, the underground and
a museum to show the possibilities of a direct approach to capturing a
pose with a minimum of line. Notice the emphasis of putting the weight
on one leg in the standing poses; the emphasis on relaxation in the
sitting poses. There was no penciling in first --- they were done
directly in ink.

**Good Habits**\
People usually do what they are in the habit of doing. That may seem
like an obvious thing to say, but it is significant in a number of ways.
Arguing in its favor, it is a comfortable way of living. There are a
minimum of decisions that require attention, and hopefully the things
you are in the habit of doing and the manner in which you do them are
compatible with your idea of the \"ideal\" life. And if you\'re studying
to be a concert pianist or a rock band drummer or a pro-tennis player,
you had better submit to some rigorous habit forming -- such as hours
and hours of practice.

Gesture Drawing For Animation

**A Simple Approach to Drawing**\
For those in my class who have had little instruction or experience, I
would suggest adopting a very simple approach to drawing. Even those who
are experienced but have neglected working from a model can benefit from
this.

The most logical approach when faced with a model is to lay in the basic
pose with some simple elemental shapes. Ignore the details of the
costume. First study the pose for the gesture---you may have to add a
little of your own thespianism---then look for weight distribution and
over all abstract shape (silhouette), ignoring all particulars like
muscles or other detail, and go for the general, overall generic
gesture. This gives you the\
opportunity also to concentrate on relative proportions. Proportions are
important and you must develop sensitivity to them---Mickey, Roger
Rabbit, the Mermaid, Eric,\
Sebastian---all with distinct proportions.

Here are some suggestions for a simple approach. You'll not be
encumbered or confused by a multitude of superfluous lines and puzzling
shapes. Once you have the pose captured, the costume will be easier to
put on. And using the known facts about wrinkles, you will be able to
pick and choose the appropriate wrinkles from the model or make up some
of your own. Let me suggest that in working out your "shorthand"
body-shape, when the chest and hip are twisted, they can be handled as
separate shapes. That way you can more easily draw them facing in
different directions. When they are not twisting, the chest and hip
areas can be treated as one shape.

35

Gesture Drawing For Animation

This kind of thinking will lead to more expressive drawing, especially
in animation where body language is so important. It will aid you in
capturing the essence of a gesture, and with an economy of lines. My
philosophy is: if you can draw it with 10 lines, why use 75? And who can
argue with the philosophy: if you can draw it in 5 minutes, why take a
half hour?

A loose style allows you to study and practice drawing
action---something that is hard to do if you try to make a cleaned-up,
finished drawing as you go.

**The Solid-Flexible Model**\
Humans, most animals and to a degree cartoon characters are constructed
on a solidflexible basis:

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image128.png)
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image129.png)
A cartoon character is more flexible, but
the principle of solid-flexible is applicable because the same parts are
there---they are merely caricatured.

The solid-flexible concept is the basis for all the angles that portray
the various actions, moods, and expressions that we are called upon to
draw. Each section has a limited yet unique movement to perform. Those
movements are the means through which we express all of our body
communications. Try to relate some incident in you life, or mimic
someone else\'s with your neck in a brace and your hands tied behind
your back. You would make up for it by bending at the waist and the
knees. You would make the whole upper part of you body do what your head
normally does, and the bending of your knees take the place of hand
gestures.

We\'ll see more of the solid-flexible model later in animating squash
and stretch.

Add a slight angle or give it a twist and the illusion is even more
apparent:

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image147.png)


It is more difficult to achieve three dimensions with an orb or
spherical shape, but it can be done with the aid of the rules of
perspective. For instance when drawing a head, the nose, forehead,
cheeks, ears and chin may be thought of as shapes that overlap other
shapes.

If the model\'s pose forms a rectangle viewed straight on, that
rectangle, from a
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image150.png)
\
three-quarter angle, would look like this:

The degree of diminishing size (perspective wise) would depend on how
close to the model (or object) we are and at what angle we are seeing
it.

If our eye is 1 foot from a rectangle measuring 17\' by 20\'
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image151.png)
,\
at a 7/8 degree
angle![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image152.png)
 the far side will appear to be about 7
inches high, meaning that within 20 inches the upright line has
diminished by more than one half. At 6 feet it is only 4 inches shorter,
and at 12 feet it is only 2 inches shorter. So the ratio of diminishing
perspective lessens as the distance increases.

So the factors that concern us are\
� how far from the object are we and\
� what is the angle of perspective; that is:

If we varied the sizes they would appear to be at different distances
from us (the \"diminishing size\" rule):\
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image158.png)


The first two rules, I think, are a preparation for the third
one---surface plus size, a rule that is very usable in animation. For
instance when working on a scene with a layout like this:\
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image159.png)


A character standing on that plain would have two feet fitted to that
surface, creating not only a stable stance but also a third dimension:\
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image160.png)
\
and of course any props such as Apples, Cans, Bowls, and so on.

**Overlap**\
If we put two of the dimes side by side, we create and are aware of the
space between them (two-dimensional space).

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image161.png)
\
Now if we place one behind the other (the overlap rule), plus making one
of them diminished in size (one of the rules of perspective), we create
a three-dimensional negative space:

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image162.png)
\
The overlap rule is very important to all classes of drawing, especially
when the illusion of third dimension is desirable.

Gesture Drawing For Animation

Without the \"T\"s, all those lines would run together, and depth would
be destroyed:

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image168.png)
Along these lines (slight pun intended) we might
introduce the \"L\" rule. In cases where one thing meets another but is
neither in front of nor behind it (changes direction but does not
overlap), but where differentiation is needed or desirable---use the
\"L\" rule:

> ![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image169.png)


A *tangent* occurs when two or more lines meet or merge into one another
so there is no differentiation between the parts which they describe. A
simple example is two mountain shapes drawn with no overlap, which
automatically creates a tangent and destroys any illusion of depth
whatever:\
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image170.png)


The simple solution to this problem is to add overlap:

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image171.png)


Making it very clear which hill is in front of the other. Then if you
force the perspective by adding surface plus size to the drawing it will
be more definite and read much faster.

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image172.png)
\
Tangents also occur when one line ends at some point then seems to
continue on at another point:

**Surface Lines**\
The importance and usefulness of the surface lines rule can only be
hinted at. In a rendered drawing or painting, the artist has untold
nuances of color, shading and rendering to emphasize the depth. The
animator has only line, plus, of course the rules of perspective. As for
surface lines, there are usually very few in a line drawing. Using a
cigar with its surface lines (the band), the importance of using them
for direction and depth can easily be seen:

> ![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image180.png)


There are few areas on cartoon bodies that can be used like the cigar
band. If none at all, the two objects would look like each other only
one smaller than the other.

> ![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image181.png)


So the artist must use whatever suggests itself. A sleeve for instance:

Even the line of the nostrils does the came thing:

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image187.png)


Likewise the brows, cheeks, and so on. Anything on a curved surface will
do it.

Surface lines on a flat surface work differently. When they are tilted
they simply get closer together:\
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image188.png)


In the case of heads, the basic structure has to serve as a surface
line. For instance the eye, nose and mouth lines---unseen, but implied
and depicted by the placement of the eyes and mouth and the direction
they take when the head is tilted:\
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image189.png)


Along with these "unseen" surface lines, there is overlap such as (in
this case) the hair, first being seen somewhat behind the forehead then
reversing to be in front of the forehead in the second drawing. The ear
employs another rule: Foreshortening. The other rules---surface plus
size and perspective---would have come into play had the head turned to
the side:\

He uses the principle of overlap to illustrate an example of
foreshortening. What I am suggesting is: everything in a
three-dimensional environment is one thing overlapping another in space,
whether they are connected like the parts of a leg (or a nose) or are
separate. Even then, nothing is really separate, for all things are
connected by the matrix of space that they occupy. In painting we can
use atmospheric perspective to show where the objects are in space if
they don\'t overlap. In drawing with line we can use another of the
principles of perspective: diminishing size or surface plus diminishing
size:

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image195.png)


**Direction**\
Bruce McIntyre\'s system also involved directional symbols, consisting
of simple arrows pointing in a number of directions. Each arrow and its
direction had a code number. Their use was related to the manner in
which Bruce taught drawing. I had never involved myself with his use of
them, but the principle of it completely captivated me. It has
influenced every drawing and painting I've made since being exposed to
it. It has made me conscious of the fact that everything is pointing in
some direction; pointing away from us or sideways to us or three
quarters up at a certain angle; straight at us or slightly to the left
or right or down. Most often these directional lines coincide with
perspective lines and have a common vanishing point.

In the case of drawing a figure, the line directions are not random but
have to do with the pose or action. To be conscious of the direction
that arms, legs, fingers, and so on are pointing is the key to the
three-dimensional drawing. It is the thing that reveals to us the six
rules of perspective. For instance, if in drawing the legs of a
character you find one pointing toward you and the other pointing away:

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image196.png)


You know that the surface lines will be dictated by those directions and
also surface plus size will influence the placement and size of the
feet, overlap will be necessary to show the right leg is in front of the
left leg. Foreshortening will be subtle but the left leg will diminish
in size as it recedes from hip to ankle:

from you while the other increases; employing the foreshortening rule.
The head being in front of the chest applies the rule of overlap while
the rule of surface plus size is\
employed in the feet.

Being aware of these rules is a positive aid in drawing, allowing you to
progress directly to the pose, rather than rely on a lot of doodling,
pencil manipulation and haphazard accidentals.

This system will also help with all the other rules: Surface Lines,
Surface plus Size, Overlap, and as mentioned above Foreshortening.

These ever helpful elements of perspective are present in every area of
every drawing we will ever make. Being conscious of them will be a great
help, plus a great comfort, in our quest for good draftsmanship. Not
that draftsmanship is the ultimate goal, but it does take draftsmanship
to express oneself in animation. Knowing and using these principles when
needed is like having a good road map when traveling in unfamiliar
places.

Here are two corrections I saved from the class. The rules of overlap
and surface lines are applicable here. Notice how the male figure
stooping over needed more angle to bring him forward at 3/4 view.

provide the solution---the forehead overlapping the cheeks, the cheeks
overlapping the chin, and the ear, placed on a surface line, overlapping
the jaw.

While in line alone it might have to be done so:

...depending, of course, on the type of character being drawn.

**Simplifying Heads**\
Often in animation, close-ups or waist-shots are featured. Because of
this, it behooves us to spend sometime in a study of heads and the upper
torso. The emphasis should still be on gesture, and as we do with the
full figure, we should ignore the details as much as possible. A very
simple symbol for the head shape, eyes, nose and mouth will suffice to
\"nail down\" the gesture or expression.

We are all at different stages of drawing ability, so some may feel it
unnecessary to start with simple shapes. If so, try to treat it like a
refresher course and spend a little time at it.

I think it\'s pretty safe, if not essential, to think of the head as
basically two oval shapes. Those shapes automatically suggest a kind of
flat plane on the top of the head, plus that bump at the back of the
head; a flatness for the face and a chin.

It even helps locate a place for the ear:

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image213.png)
\
From the front, a circle for the top portion of the head and the oval
for the facial area again automatically suggest a temple, the narrow
facial area, and a chin.

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image214.png)


It helps to talk your way through a drawing, because ordinarily we
don\'t carry very many fancy descriptive terms in our everyday
vocabulary. If we follow just the simple things we can describe, we\'ll
have less trouble. For instance, for the animator a few words like
\"structure,\" \"angle,\" \"squash\" and \"stretch\" will carry us
pretty far into any drawing.

I will now add the shoulders with that in mind:

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image220.png)


Making sure to connect the neck gracefully to the shoulder on the left,
and connecting the other shoulder with a nice strong angle to give it a
three-dimensional look, because I know that this
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image221.png)
 puts the neck in front of the shoulder
better than this:
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image222.png)
or this:
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image223.png)
 or this:
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image224.png)

 or this:
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image226.png)
 .

The hair is quite a dominant feature on this person and since the head
is tilted that way I see that the hair reacts somewhat like the neck. So
I\'ll draw a squash on the left side and a stretch on the other:\
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image227.png)
\
I want to make sure I\'m being clear (and simple) about the hair, and
though on the model it sort of goes this way and that, I must be
logical. So I will simply drape the hair over the shoulder on the squash
side and let the hair stretch down past the right shoulder, and oh yes,
making sure to use that principle of perspective (one object in front of
another to create depth) by getting a good angle on the meeting place of
the hair and shoulder.

Also, regardless of how wind-blown the hair is or what the styling is,
basically the top of the head is rather flat, the back of the head is
rather like a skull, the forehead does a rather sharp turn then gently
curves down to the chin, which is rather sharp, but sometimes a

Gesture Drawing For Animation

Some, such as Mickey mouse and Donald Duck have been under continual
evolvement for their entire lifetime Because many characters are built
somewhat on the same basic formula, great care must be taken to retain
the subtleties that distinguish one from another. Animation allows the
characters to be freely caricatured in action but though the shapes are
stretched and squashed to unbelievable limits, they must be recognizable
as that character at all times.

A good model is one with shapes that can be animated into various poses
and expressions without losing its character. The general shape of the
head and its individual features must be established in its normal state
first so that squashes and stretches will be\
recognized as such. In other words, a thoroughly recognizable norm will
serve to emphasize any deviation from it, giving added punch and
authority to special\
expressions.

On the other hand, since we have already enjoined the audience to
suspend their disbelief in such beings as talking mice and temperamental
ducks, it is important to sustain this newly created plausibility by
keeping the characters consistent. Studying the model and people in
general with this in mind gives us purpose and hopefully the added
incentive to do so.

Try to keep from getting too serious while head sketching. After all,
you are in the cartoon business and most of the Disney characters are
somewhat comical, and if not comical then at least they are caricatures
of serious beings. Usually when a person takes himself too seriously he
is in our eyes a \"comedian.\" He is ripe for caricature. So if cartoons
are not somewhat caricatures of reality they may be taken too seriously
and lose that special spark of humor needed in cartoons.

Museums and living rooms are full of serious portraits that are just
dying to be retouched with a little humor. But, of course, portraits
were not invented to make people smile---cartoons were. If you think the
world is all so serious, you should be a historian or a philosopher, but
if you desire to bring a little humor into the lives of those
humor-hungry people \"out there,\" then be a cartoonist and be serious
about losing some of that\
seriousness.

Very few, if any, of the animators I\'ve known found drawing easy. One
of Ollie\
Johnston\'s sayings, \"It ain\'t easy,\" became a studio quip. Drawing
funny cartoons was and is a serious business. It seems like the funniest
scenes were the ones that were \"sweat over\" most. They were serious
matters that required the animator to never forget (in all his groping
and mental anguish) that the result he was after was to make the
audience smile.

On the following page are a few of the characters from Disney features
and shorts. They are all built on some basic head shape or shapes. After
which the details such as features and so on are added. The shapes are
flexible to a degree that is animatable, but never so

Some of your drawings from the class are suggestive of the way I think
the head studies might go. They are simple enough to allow the
expression to beam through not weighted down with tons of ostentatious
falderal!

enhance the gesture. But if the drawing has not captured the gesture,
all the manipulation of wrinkles, lumps, bulges, folds, and seams will
not bring off the drawing. A real solid, expressive, sparkly drawing is
one where the clothing is doing what the body is causing it to do.

The best thing for you to do (to keep your sanity) is strive to handle
it in the simplest way possible. In animation, costumes may run from
simple to complex in style, but they are all handled in a simple manner
when it comes to folds and wrinkles.

It helps to mentally take the clothing apart to see how it is
constructed. For instance a sleeve: how big around is the shoulder
opening; how is it attached to the bodice; does it taper; does the
shoulder seam attach at or below the shoulder? Ward Kimball's great
observation is very apropos here. He said if he could take something
apart and put it back together again, he could draw it.

For the sake of studying the figure for animation, lines of clothing
should not be sketched in just for an impression---they should be
logical. If you were to use that drawing in a scene, those drapery lines
would have to animate as a secondary action---the primary action being
the body itself.

Reasons! Reasons! Reasons! Always look for logical reasons for the
shapes of the clothing or drapery---and the reason will always be found
in the bodily gestures.

There is a kind of shorthand for drapery that is standardized for all
characters. Most Disney characters only have wrinkles at the joints, and
then only when there is pressure applied by bending or squeezing. So
they'll occur at elbows and knees, and at the waist when seated. Women's
clothes have wrinkles caused by pleats, gathers, puffed sleeves, etc.,
but you can always count them on two or three fingers. An excess of
material will cause meaningless folds, bumps, and bulges.

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image261.png)
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image262.png)


This is not to suggest simplicity is easy---just less frustrating.

A clear understanding of drapery plus a general understanding of the
types of garment construction would be helpful. There is a book called,
*The Complete Book of Fashion*

67

No. 7 is the "inert fold". This is the only fold that seems to have no
potential for energy;
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image269.png)
\
it just lies there, inactive.

Being aware of these somewhat simple categories of folds will help you
to interpret what happens to drapery under certain conditions. Also, the
more complex actions and poses will cause those categories to overlap
and produce a hybrid fold, which, without the benefit of knowing the
origin of the contributing folds, might prove to be slightly
bewildering.

So when you see a fold that is hard to categorize, with the help of this
list, you can search out its origins and, lo, erudition shall prevail.
Identifying the types of folds will be harder when drawing from the
model, for natural drapery doesn't always just lay it all out in simple
terms.

However, when drawing on your own, such as in animation, you can use
more simplified forms of drapery---those that match the action or
enhance the pose. With the help of Vilppu's list of folds, it will be
easier to spot and identify such problem areas as you are forming your
first impression.

It might also help to develop a vocabulary of drapery action terms such
as: *hang, suspend, dangle, swing freely, be pendent, adhere to, sag,
revolve around, drape, incline, bend, droop, descend, incline, sway,
dip, settle, plunge, drag, trail, hang over, drape over, envelope, wrap,
adorn, enshroud*. Each of these suggests an individualized action that
helps to get you involved in what is happening to the drapery. It is
good to be aware of the vast number of possibilities that are always
present---especially if you are\
Academy-award winning scene-conscious.

Here are three extreme drawings by Milt Kahl. They show how directly he
went at drawing the figure and they demonstrate how, in spite of using
folds in the girl\'s skirt, it is basically treated as a shape. Glance
from one drawing to another and observe how the overlap on the skirt
embellishes the action.

Gesture Drawing For Animation

**Superficial Appearance vs. Creative Portrayal**\
In the course of animating on a picture, you will be called upon to draw
many different actions, each one calling for a distinct set of gestures.
Your character might have to display a variety of expressions like
happiness, anger, confusion, determination, etc., with actions that
match each of those emotions. The character will no doubt have to walk,
turn, stoop, stretch, extend arms, etc. There will be a number of
characters in the film and each one of them will have different
personalities that will require appropriate gestures, none of which will
be repeated---at least not in exactly the same way.

In a classroom situation where you are studying a live model, it is
nearly impossible to anticipate those action requirements, so you have
to concentrate on the ability to capture those gestures the model
performs for you. This, in effect, hones your sensitivity for seeing
bodily actions, so that you are better able to apply your skills to
future needs. It is nearly impossible also to find models who are
\"look-alikes\" to match the characters in the various stories. This may
be a blessing, in that if you could find them you would surely be
tempted to copy the superficial appearance of the model, rather than
using the time and opportunity to further your skills in gesture
drawing. After all, gesture drawing to the animator is what acting is to
the stage or movie actor. What the actor portrays on the stage or before
the camera is what the animator draws on paper.

When working from a model you must keep in mind the fact that you are
not copying what is before you, but that you are searching for a
gesture---one that will be applicable to any character that you might be
called upon draw (animate), say, the mermaid, one of the sailors, or the
prince in the "Mermaid," Mickey or Goofy. Again I use the term "shift
gears" (mental gears), to picture the release from the shackles of any
false burden, responsibility or obligation to copy the model.

A scene of animation is more or less a series of gesture drawings. The
difference being that an animator\'s drawing is likely to have some
things in it that are not associated with still drawings. For instance,
an animation drawing might have some overlapping action, some drag, some
squash and stretch, a stance that may be off balance, or a view that one
would avoid or adjust in a still drawing. But basically the extremes in
a scene of animation are gestural drawings created to fit the needs of
the story.

A perceptive and keen observation in regard to gesture (acting) is
essential to the animator.

The purpose of working with a live model is to sharpen your awareness of
the\
possibilities of the human figure to tell a \"story\" with body
language. Assuming you understand basic anatomy, you know where the
knees are, how they work and their general functions; likewise all other
parts of the body. At this point, to merely copy what is before you
would be just to solidify your position on a plateau, short of your
potential.

in the plot. But if I\'m not careful, I get caught up in admiring the
details and how the story is being told, getting behind in what the
story is about.

We have been having some terrific models whose \"details\" (body syntax)
are fascinating to the point of distraction. It seems like the more
interesting the details, the more difficult it is to see the simplicity
of the gesture. So, as it takes a special effort on my part to read for
the story, so it is with most of us---we have to make a special effort
to draw for the gesture.

Earlier I mentioned body syntax. That\'s a phrase worth coining. The
non-grammatical meaning of syntax is: \"Connected system or order;
orderly arrangement.\" What is a pose or gesture but an orderly
arrangement of body parts to display a mood, demeanor, attitude,
mannerism, expression, emotion---whatever. That phrase \"orderly
arrangement\" (body syntax), is worth ruminating over. An orderly
arrangement of body parts. I love it. Even the sentence places
arrangement before parts.

Once the physical faculties of manipulating a pen or pencil to one\'s
satisfaction is conquered, that side of drawing is taken care of and
from there on it is mental. It\'s then the ability to analyze, imagine;
to caricature, to assemble and organize all the separate elements of
storytelling into one drawing or into a series of drawings (animation).
As we have come to realize since Dr. Betty Edwards, drawing is a right
brain activity. The left brain is a serious namer of things, while the
right brain uses all that seriousness for some creative purpose. The
left and right sides of the brain are the \"odd couple\" of the cerebral
community---the right side being the slightly less serious.

Gesture Drawing For Animation

For this first pose, I suggested that one of the many possible
interpretations might be to let the principles of drawing permeate one's
thinking-squash and stretch, angles, simplification, balance, tension,
straight against curve, and perspective. Try to do it in about 10 or 15
seconds. Forget the details; that stuff's all on the "model sheets."

Here's one where you might line things up in an attempt to point her
attention out to the "audience" she is entertaining. You might drop her
right arm to get it out of the look's way, and curve her back to help
send her communication with the audience forward. You might even have
the little flower on her hat jump out at them:\

You know the pose---modest, bashful, shy\... or better yet pretending to
be shy. It's in the shoving the hands into the pockets, the dragging of
one foot, the tilt of the head, which tries to hide behind one of the
shoulders:

**Feel, As Well As See, the Gesture**\
I repeatedly harp on feeling the pose rather than merely looking at it.
By looking at it only, you have to keep looking at it repeatedly as you
copy the parts. In feeling the pose, I mean actually picturing in your
mind yourself doing the pose. If you have to, stand up, put down your
drawing board and assume the pose. Feel which muscles pull or contract
to get which stretch or squash. Feel where the weight falls, what is
entailed to keep your balance. Feel the psychological attitude it
imparts. For example, if the head is drooped, does it evoke a sad or
disappointed feeling? If the head is held high, do you feel proud or
haughty or reverent---or what?

So with the whole body, impose some kind of attitude on it. Then you
have that pose locked into your mind and can summon it up at will by
simply seeing it in your mind and assuming that attitude. As a matter of
fact you can see it from any vantage point---you could even do some
mental levitation and look down on it from above.

Contrast that approach with the slow and ponderous neck-tiring process
of looking at the model, noticing the angle of the upper arm, looking
back to the paper and. sketching in the upper arm, then looking at the
model to see what the lower arm is doing, then back to the paper to
sketch that in, then back to the model to search out the next thing to
draw,

**Draw with a Purpose**\
To doodle, according to the dictionary, means to scribble aimlessly. A
drawing on the other hand has an aim; it has a reason for being. It may
be an illustration, a depiction, a caricature, a recording of some
incident, a person, or a decoration. When making a drawing for animation
or for animation study it must be saying something, that is, depicting
an action or a mood, otherwise it becomes a mere doodle.

If you wanted to play Mozart music on the piano, you wouldn't doodle on
the piano hoping someday to come across something that sounded like
Mozart. No, first you would study the rules---the rudiments of music and
then with a little practice you could bring Mozart to life. Drawing is
no different.

An animator cannot relax into the luxury of doodling, for his drawings
have to "say" something, must communicate something.

So\.... whenever studying drawing to better yourself for animation,
don't doodle (draw aimlessly). Draw with a purpose---go for the gesture.
Save your doodling for telephone calls.

**Dividing the Body into Units**\
All too often in sketching, if you don\'t see the whole figure (the
figure as a whole, that is) it is possible to end up with a delightful
drawing, but which is at variance with the pose or gesture. This is fine
when doodling---to start out with a nothing in mind---somewhere on the
paper---and end up with a presentable drawing with a gesture of its own
(but not

81

Gesture Drawing For Animation

that in a model drawing situation, the pose is already there; searching
is not necessary. The use of a pen forces one to distill the essence of
the pose in the mind's eye and in turn draw it the way one sees it.

Of course, when there is no model and when a needed gesture is not clear
in the mind, by all means start searching. I am not putting down using a
multitude of lines---one may come to rely on it for it sometimes
accidentally locates things in its meandering lines, from which all one
has to do is pick out the best ones. Ultimately, the searching method
may be the style you will use in animation, for there will be no model
before you to lean on.

But this method borders on doodling, which can become a habit. Even when
you don\'t have a model to hold the pose, you can use your kinetic sense
of motion---the feeling of the pose in our own bodies, or "living" the
pose, or being at one with the gesture and "knowing" it, without having
to discover the gesture in a model. The ability to distill the essence
of the pose, acquired through the practice of using a pen, will let you
draw the pose the way you feel it in your body. This will in every sense
be a shortcut to capturing the gesture on paper.

**Simplicity for the Sake of Clarity**\
One of our models, Ian Steele, said a very significant thing to me after
a session. He said after holding a pose for some minutes he no longer
had that fresh, intense feeling for the pose that he had when he first
assumed it. That is something that happens in all phases of life. The
artist, when he first gets an inspiration or tackles a pose in an action
analysis class, sees the pose, is struck by its clarity, its
expressiveness, then after working on it for a while that first
impression is gone and with it goes any chance of capturing it on paper.
That\'s the reason we should learn to get that first impression down
right away---while it\'s fresh, while it\'s still in that first
impression stage before it starts to fade.

It\'s not an easy thing to do. You have studied anatomy and have spent
many hours admiring your favorite artists until a foregone conclusion as
to how to draw something sets in. Now you are bombarded with new
gestures and new concepts. You are called upon to see the essence of the
gesture and get it down before it slides back into a watereddown pose or
before your foregone conclusions alter your new found vision.

Detail doesn\'t buy you anything at this stage of the drawing. Doodling
with detail will cause you to lose that first impression. The time to
study bone structure and muscles is in anatomy class or at home with a
good book on anatomy. In an action analysis class a rough circle is all
you need to locate and suggest a knee or an elbow or a wrist. Two lines
is all you need to locate and suggest the various parts of the arms and
legs---preferably one of them straight and the other curved; the
straight one being used on the stretch side and the curved one being
used on the squash side. When I say locate and suggest, that is exactly
what and all you need. What you are drawing is a pose, not parts. The
simplest kind of suggestion is the surest way to a good drawing.

> 1\. **Weight distribution.** How the figure balances itself because of
> what it is doing.
>
> 2\. **Thrust.** Body language usually requires a hip to be thrust out,
> a shoulder up, knees apart, or an arm out (as in throwing something or
> pointing), etc.
>
> 3\. **Angles.** Straight up and down figures are generally stiff and
> static. Angles will add life and a feeling of movement.
>
> 4\. **Tension.** Whenever one member of the body moves there is the
> set up between it and its counterpart. You can capture an effective
> tension by working one elbow against the other elbow; one knee against
> the other. Likewise the feet, hands, and the shoulders. Never draw one
> appendage without planning a counter move with its opposite\....
> never.
>
> 5\. **Straight against curve.** All work and no play makes a long and
> dreary day---or something like that. All curves and no straights make
> a dreary drawing. Straights and curves used indiscriminately are but
> trickery, but when used logically they can emphasize and clarify the
> gesture. Straights and curves also tie in perfectly with one of
> animation's key tools, *squash and stretch*.
>
> 6\. **Extremes of the pose.** Extremes in animation usually mean the
> farthermost extension of some pose or the drawing just prior to a
> change of direction. A single drawing also has extremes, which, in a
> flash, explains what is happening in the pose. Those extremes are
> vital to such an explanation. To the degree they are missing or
> diluted, the drawing will deteriorate from "expressive" to "bland" to
> "confusing" to downright "boring." Silhouette almost explains

Gesture Drawing For Animation

A perceptive overall distribution of all these elements concentrates the
viewer\'s attention on the vital aspects of the gesture. To gloss over
them in a muddled and nebulous way is to cheat the viewer out of a clear
look at what you are trying to "say".

Here is another quote from "The Art Spirit" (I replaced the words
*portrait* and *painting* with the word *drawing*.)

> "An interest in the subject; something you want to say definitely
> about the subject; this is the first condition of a drawing. The
> processes of drawing spring from this interest, this definite thing to
> be said. Completion does not depend on material representation. The

> constructive of an idea, expressive of an emotion. Every factor in the

An actor may have a pleasant voice, perfect diction, proper emphasis,
all the qualities necessary to make a good performer, but if his
accompanying body language is unclear, the audience is left in a "no
man's land", and up goes the "TILT" sign. The audience is left with some
undecipherable bits of information. Likewise the artist. There may be an
appealing technique, but if the message is garbled, the purpose of the
drawing is lost.

The accompanying drawings all contain corrections that illustrate the
all-important elements of the pose. The correction (suggestions) were
not done to teach anyone "how to draw," but rather how to see those
elements and to make them the basis for all drawings. They are easy to
spot if you look for them when making your first impression. If you
start your drawing without locating them, you may find yourself drawing
without a purpose, or your purpose may evolve into a desperate search to
find out what went wrong with your drawing.

In the above drawing the gesture was
turning out to be more of an, "Oh, my tooth hurts" nature, rather than
one of reflection or deep thought. Strengthening the angles also helped
to show the weight of the head on the hand, also allowing for a more
definite angle of the wrist.

\[Below is\] another case of overlooking the life-giving qualities of
angles. Even a still drawing should look like it has action in it (even
repose is an action), and a skillful, bold, adventurous use of angles
will contribute to its presence.

In this drawing it looks as though the artist tried to straighten the
body up and even make a front view of it, interpreting the angles to
suit those intentions. One doesn't have to invent angles to interpret a
gesture---the body with its solid/flexible construction will dictate
them for us.

**Applying Angles and Tension in Our Drawings**\
One day as my wife, Dee, and I were coming home from the tennis courts,
we stopped along the country road so she could clip some reed-like
plants for use in her basket making. While stopped, I, as usual, took up
pen and pad and rather unthinkingly sketched what was before me---a
multitude of things that were not a good set up composition-wise.

I simply went through the motions of sketching. I got a lot of it down
but it was a hodgepodge. Suddenly, I realized that if one of my students
had done that, I would have reminded them of the rules of perspective
and certainly because it was so fresh in my mind, having worked up a
handout paper on angles and tension that week. So I corrected my
sketch\--several times, attempting to simplify and clarify things, aware
that I was now drawing, not copying. The possibilities became infinite.
I was no longer confused nor intimidated by the array of bits and
pieces---by the parts. I began to see the scene as a whole, with all the
parts fitting together into what I thought of as landscape gestures.

The subject was a landscape but the process of sketching it was the same
as if it had been a live model. I make no special claims for the
drawings---they are crude and quickly drawn, their only purpose being to
demonstrate a shifting from copying to creating. Betty Edwards (*Drawing
on the Right Side of the Brain*), would have said, "Shifting from the

How can we apply all this to figure drawing? On the following page I
have reproduced a class drawing, which for the short time in which it
was done, is quite anatomically solid.

Notice in one of the sketches I copied the angles of the lower legs,
while in the other 2 sketches, I varied them. Also notice how some sharp
angled lines were used on the figure\'s left foot to make it read
clearly as it works against the right leg. The student\'s drawing is a
little nebulous in that area.

As for tension in the drawings---imagine a large rubber band connected
from hand to hand, foot to foot, knee to knee; hand to knee, head to
foot etc. Tension is simply the stretching, pulling, elastic force,
pressure or exertion that takes place in a pose or an action. So in
effect, to capture the essence of this pose, we would not merely be
drawing the left hand and the left knee, but more importantly, the
tension between them.

**Angles and Tension**\
I can't resist pushing the idea of using angles in your drawings. At
first it may seem that you might end up with a very abstract or stiff
drawing. But that needn't be the case.

Perhaps there is a subtle difference in saying, "A drawing is angular"
as opposed to saying "Angles have been used in the drawing."

Don't confuse angles with angularity. Some of the most graceful people
are put together with 45-degree angles. Watch them---they seem to have
studied how to play one angle off another to create those tantalizing
poses. Sometimes the changes of angles of cheek against flock, or hand
against cheek are so subtle they are felt rather than seen, If you are
just looking they are seductive---if you are drawing, they suddenly
become almost invisible---difficult to see and capture. That's why
sometimes you have to draw not what you see but what you know is there
or what you feel is there.

In the more cartoony characters, angles are indispensable. Notice how
expressive these actions are and how angles play such an important part
in capturing those actions.

In the drawing below, the student has straightened up the torso, the
arms and the hands. I suggested that the gardener would lean into
whatever he was doing, bending forward from the waist. To guide the
attention downward to the cutter, I lowered his left hand. See the
triangle it creates between the two hands and the face---it sets up a
downward movement in the direction of the cutters. His right hand being
higher, calls for the right elbow and shoulder to be higher, eliminating
a sameness of angles, and sets up a tension---as if he were pushing on
the cutter handles.

your enthusiasm or clarity of vision, and perhaps soften the angles just
a little more. Your accolades will be soft too, for it is the strong
statements that get the oohs and aahs.

Sometimes when drawing from the model, the angles are just barely
discernible and so need special attention to find. Once found they need
accenting to make sure they are still subtle, but at the same time make
a strong statement.

This was beginning to be a nice drawing, but was also becoming a
straight up and down thing. The pose had some subtle angles that I tried
to point out.

If I had not interrupted this sketch it might have turned out to be a
very sensitive drawing. But the whole gesture was overlooked. Note the
acute angles the gesture needed to get its story told. Not just the neck
angle but the face angle against the neck, the front neck angle against
the back, the neck angle against the shoulders. One should never work
one angle by itself\--it must work against other angles in order to
contribute to the overall maximum statement.

In every move a figure (human or cartoon) makes its adjustments in the
various parts or groups of parts to pull off the move. Usually a
preparation or anticipation precedes the move and more than likely
involves a squash, plus the distribution of weight to intensify the
thrust of the move. The move or action itself usually is a stretch. But
even in an extreme squash drawing, some parts have to stretch to get
into that position.

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image353.png)

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image355.png)


The principles involved are simple and obvious and are applicable to any
action. If the body leans forward to grasp some object with its
outstretched hand, there must be stretch, and there must be an
adjustment in weight distribution such as counterbalancing with the
opposite arm, or placing one foot closer to the object than the other to
keep the body balanced.

There are other things which will contribute to the reach also. Eye
contact with the object funnels the attention to the reason for the
action, keeping the path between the hand and the object, and the eyes
and the object, clear of any obstruction; opening the hand in
anticipation for the grasp. Timing which we can\'t depict in a sketch,
but which we should feel, is also important. It will be different for
delicately picking up the object as opposed to seizing it in a broad
sweep of the arm, plus of course the continual redistribution of weight,
and the choice of which part of the move will be reserved for the
extreme extreme.

Gesture Drawing For Animation

The imaginary cube reveals the three-dimensional negative space so
important in capturing a third dimensional drawing on a two dimensional
surface. If all the rules of perspective aren\'t considered while making
a drawing or animating a scene, the character could end up looking as
though it were confined between two panes of glass, forcing it to do its
thing on a two-dimensional stage. Extending that plane into the third
dimension gives the character depth as well as lateral space to move in.

Feeling that three dimensional negative space can also be helpful in
creating tension in a pose or action.

I thought these two drawings (above) by Whitney Martin were worthy of a
closer look. Let me help you fully appreciate them with a short,
positive critique: notice on the girl drawing how Whitney lifted her
left shoulder high because the left hand is on the elevated hip. This
lowered the right shoulder and tilted the whole chest area to the right.

Then, and this is a wonderful touch, he straightened the neck for
balance, drawing it closer to the left shoulder. That\'s stretching
things anatomically, but boy, is it effective, gesture-wise. There is a
powerful straight from the left shoulder out to the elbow, which works
strikingly against the curve of the right shoulder and arm which bends
around to her front.

With some dynamically forced perspective in the drawing of the painter,
Whitney increased the sensation of space and depth. There\'s a nice
touch where the paint pail seems to be swinging---as if he had just
rubbed the brush against it. Usually I recommend something heavy like
the pail be hanging straight down to show its weight, but this swinging
pail bit is right in line with the story being told, and adds some
excitement to and already exciting drawing.

**Recreating the First Impression**\
The practical application of the ability to isolate the elements of a
scene, or in your case, a posing figure, is to quickly analyze the
components of the pose and to put them all back together again into a
good, strong first impression, any part of which you can call to mind
for reference as your drawing proceeds.

2\. to draw the player's identity in the action (that is, so they could
be identified as those two players).

I can only guess at the time involved---perhaps one hundredth of a
second to analyze the gesture and from between 15 and 45 seconds to draw
it. This is good practice, for it forces you to lock in on a good solid
first impression. In one second the pose has changed and you're stuck
with how much information you have gathered in that "Ah - Ha!" moment.
In a classroom situation where there is a model to copy from, you often
have to remind yourself that it is the gesture you are after.

It was started with a simple sketch of the whole action; then (and only
then) were the details and finishing touches added.

At some point after the initial gesture is established, certain tensions
and forces important to the gesture should be chosen, including all
parts involved, and worked on as units of action.

Every drawing will have a weight distribution or a stress or a thrust or
a twist; a squash and stretch, a pull, a push, a drag, some action or
actions that you will want to emphasize.

Choose those themes or story points or gesture topics or whatever you
want to call them and with all your awareness concentrate on
them---accentuating them, "pressing home" their importance in what you
are trying to say, in a word, caricaturing them.

For instance, in Mark's drawing, Basil is yakking about something as he
goes through a flurry of putting on his coat. At this point in the
action he has thrust his tight arm through the arm hole, causing a
stretch, and is pulling it over his shoulder with his left hand. That is
one unit of action---the two hands pulling away from each other. There
are others: the lower jaw pulling away from the nose area, the left foot
pulling away from the right foot, the corner of the cloak swinging away
from his body. They are all part of the action, but they directly relate
to one another.

So, in order to get the most out of these areas of action, you work one
of the related parts against the other. Never draw one part of the unit
alone, but concomitantly as a whole

110

Then you would concentrate on the action of the corner of the cape as it
stretches out away from his torso:\

Then the head thrust, which is set up by the sum total of all the other
parts. Notice how the nose direction is a continuation or rather a
culmination of the whole body action---clear from the left toe, but also
the belt line, the cape line; and the straight lines of the arms are
almost like a "sounding board" for the yakking that is going on:

113

Gesture Drawing For Animation

7\. This one is not a devious way to achieve a nice looking drawing but
it is a sure way to miss the gesture: drawing down one side of the body
or working on isolated areas with no thought of their correlative
opposite. One should never draw one elbow, or hand, or knee, or foot
without considering the relationship to its opposite. I should say to
its \"companion part\" for all joints and parts work in conjunction with
their counterpart. They are either complementing, balancing, opposing,
or in some way relating to one another.

8\. One of the commonest techniques used to accomplish what \"seems\" to
be gesture drawing is copying the model. An artist who has drawn a lot
and has good hand/eye coordination, can simply by multitudinous looks at
the model and back to his drawing, reproduce fairly accurately what is
before him---without ever noticing or feeling the gesture. This is
almost like photography. Later, of course, when one is called upon to
draw Mickey or Donald or say a mermaid in some particular gesture, there
will be nothing to copy or \"photograph.\" One may be required to
conjure up a multitude of gestures, heaven forbid, from one\'s
imagination.

So there in eight nutshells (an incomplete list, to be sure) are some
tricks we need not concern ourselves with in the study of gesture We are
not striving for drawings that say, \"Look at me, aren\'t I an
attractive drawing?\" but that will say, \"I have life, and feeling, and
purpose\", and the drawing will reveal that purpose.

some \"creative\" but inappropriate drawing. We must be creative within
the bounds of our media, so it is legitimate to call upon the left brain
to help out in that respect.

Most important to the success of a drawing is that first impression. If
it is perceived wrongly, the preliminary sketch will be off and all the
work put in it from then on will be a waste. You may think I\'m being
overly hard-headed about this---after all, if you finish the drawing and
it looks nice, what the heck? The point is, you want to sharpen your
skill and sensitivity to the point where you can express any gesture you
are called upon to draw. It is thrilling to see a well done anatomical
drawing, but it is deeply thrilling to see a drawing that expresses some
gesture, mood, feeling or meaningful action.

Following are a set of drawings that do just that. The artist\'s
knowledge of anatomy has been transformed to conform to the character he
was drawing. His adaptation of the anatomy of the human body was only a
tool to attain his intent. His sensibility to the personality of the
character and the resultant appropriate gestures are quite phenomenal.

(I would like to interject a word of praise and respect for the cleanup
people, including inbetweeners, for many\'s the time when the
sensitivity of the animation drawings came to full fruition in the
cleanup department.)

of Art Babbit\'s lectures. They show how he thinks in terms of
caricaturing live action for use in cartoon action.

An obvious example, but to the point (pun meant):

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image438.png)
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image439.png)


Every scene of animation and every single drawing have a theme upon
which the viewers\' attention should be directed. Every line in the
drawing must help.

It is much more difficult in music and literature. To keep a central
motif going in music for 55 minutes takes some advanced know-how and
discipline. An author has a similar problem. Whether writing a love
story or a psychic thriller, the words chosen are like the lines we use
in drawing---they help reveal and build the substance of the theme. A
wrong choice of words or phrases will spoil the mood. Things that are
not basic to the story (plot, mood or gesture) have to be left out.

Here are two sketches from the drawing class that illustrate the
\"centering down,\" the \"gathering of the forces\", the aggregation of
certain elements crucial to telling the story. (I like that word
aggregate it means: a mass of distinct things gathered together---a
total).

Gesture Drawing For Animation

So drawing is not just recording a leg here, an arm there, a head and
hands, etc. A drawing is like a parable, which is a story told to convey
a lesson. If the story reveals the meaning of the lesson it is a
success, but if it is just a cute story, it falls short of its reason
for being.

**Subtlety**\
Consider the normal upright standing position. It is not what you
ordinarily think of as an action but actually, to stand is an action.
Stand is a verb. Just think of what you have to go through to remain
standing. There is constant muscular adjustment, and according to our
individual physical structure, our attitude and the conditions around us
cause everyone\'s \"stand\" to be slightly different.

It is utterly impossible for a person to do nothing. So in effect every
position a person gets into is a pose. There\'s a challenge for you
whenever you are drawing---though the figure seems to be doing nothing,
such is not the case. You must sometimes seek out very subtle nuances to
capture the pose or gesture.

When you begin to radiate out in all directions from that upright
pose---into the millions of variations of poses and gestures the human
figure can assume---it seems to get easier. It seems like instead of
shooting an arrow at a tiny target, it\'s more like shooting it at the
\"broad side of a barn.\" But it just seems that way. There are as many
if not more\
subtleties in a broad pose as there are in a subdued one. It may not
take as much\
concentration to draw an action pose as a subtle standing pose, for you
can get away with more. But if you apply the same effort in seeking out
the subtleties of a broad pose as you must do for a less active one, you
would end up with a really nice drawing, not merely a recognizable
action.

So don\'t settle for merely recognition---go for the subtleties. If you
are animating and leaving those subtleties for the cleanup person to
find, you are expecting quite a bit. A cleanup person should be skilled
enough to \"cover\" you, but it is usually enough for the cleanup people
to hang on to whatever the animator has drawn.

If you are a cleanup person---it behooves you to train yourself in those
subtleties, so when they are needed in a scene of animation---you are
ready. And willing, let me add. Cleaning up may not have the most
glamorous aura about it, but it is an integral part of animation. After
all, yours are the actual drawings that are seen on the screen. It is my
contention that is easier to animate a loosely drawn character in a
scene than it is to clean it up. On the other hand, if the animator has
worked clean and has all the subtleties carefully drawn, then the
cleanup person\'s job is a cinch---gravy.

Gesture Drawing For Animation

The drawing on the left below is an example where the artist was merely
drawing things---heads, arms, legs, etc.---just to get them all down.
(The models were being "photographed" for the family album.) I looked
for not only the abstract shapes of the bodies but also the abstract of
the pose. I used the man's straight, more youthful body as a kind of
backboard for their attention to the camera---which is helped along by
the older woman's bent forward shape. Can you feel the movement going
off to screen left where the camera is? Angles and negative shapes are
involved also. Look from one drawing to the other and you will see what
happens to the negative shapes and how they help to define and simplify
the drawing. I made no attempt to draw a head or an arm, or a body. I
looked for the abstract shapes and they defined the body parts for me.

**Gesture to Portray an Action or a Mood**\
To further investigate the use and importance of gestures to portray an
action or a mood, I have taken a couple of simple but expressive
drawings that were made in our action analysis session and altered them
to fit other possible meanings.

The drawings on the next two pages have what you might call a basic
stance, one standing and one kneeling. Notice how, by changing some of
the extremities, the whole attitude is changed. That is because these
postures and gestures are a part of the universal language of gesture.
Posture, pose, carriage, manners, bearing, movement all tell what kind
of person it is and what that person is doing or thinking.

When certain gestures are drawn, we "read" the pose quickly because we
are educated as to their meaning. This makes it possible to communicate
in a visual way. A good pantomimist can tell all manner of stories by
gesture alone. This is part of the animator's "vocabulary" too, for in
telling a story in cartoons, he must use visual means.

Let's take a less clear silhouette and see if it could be improved
without substantially changing the pose. In the first attempt Dawson's
left elbow was extended to avoid the tangent it was forming with the
backside. His right elbow was shortened to expose more cheek, and the
tip of the hat was more clearly defined. In the second attempt the left
arm was shortened and the backside extended (the opposite from the
first), with a little of his shirttail extended, which helps to divide
and define the upper body from the lower.

The fear of straying from what is before you while drawing from the live
model can sometimes "tie your hands" (your drawing hands). An innocent
little cheat may do such wonders for your drawing that any deviation
from the "facts" will go unnoticed.

A good place to practice cheating is while drawing from the human
figure. Very often in a classroom situation you will be stuck with a
difficult angle where things that explain or complete the gesture are
hidden from you.

The challenge of adjusting the pose to better tell your story can be
invigorating. The important thing is you are not bound to copy what is
before you, but on the contrary, you are bound to tell the story of the
gesture, even if you have to cheat to do it.

Caricature, one of the animator's most valuable tools, is a total cheat.
An effective caricature can be so exaggerated that not one line of
realism remains. Even so, a good caricature can be more "real" than a
photographic copy. Tracing photostats for a scene of animation is
sufficient proof of that.

The other drawing was again from a deceptive pose, in that the clothes
contained a lot of soft curves. In cases like this, one has to cheat a
little and introduce what they know is happening rather than what they
see. For instance, in this pose the girl's right shoulder had to lower
in shape as well as position; the front of the neck had to stretch to
reach from the raised chin to the lowered pit of the neck; and the coat
had to hang with some straights to contrast with the bunched up cloth at
the elbows.

Here are two beautiful drawings by Carl Erickson. Lots of "overlap,"
"diminishing size," "surface lines," and "foreshortening". Observe how
every line and shape and detail seem to direct your eye right to the
center of interest, the center of interest being a look. Every line on
the woman carries your eye to that space between her eye and the mirror.
The man's hat brim and shoulder form a path for his look to travel on.

The book I got this from has this to say about Erickson and his
drawings: "They give the impression of having sprung to life without
suffering the usual labor pains. But his performance looks too easy; its
nonchalance is deceptive. It is not accomplished without a struggle.
Erickson indeed is a hard-working man, a very serious artist who is
usually practicing when not actually performing. In spare moments he is
usually drawing from the model\.... and his sketchbook goes with him to
the restaurant and to the theatre."

Back to walking. When I am walking, I am (just) walking. I feel the cool
breeze or the soothing warmth of the sun; I hear whatever sounds pass
into my consciousness; I feel my heels strike the ground as they make
contact; I enjoy the sway of my body as it negotiates for balance and
forward motion; I watch the scenery go by and am aware of the
three-dimensional quality unfolding around me. These factors are all
happening simultaneously yet can be enjoyed separately. The same goes
for every activity of your daily living. It is possible to go through
life (or sometimes just big chunks of it) in a sort of dream state
wherein you don\'t really experience the things you do. And so it is
possible to make a drawing (many drawings) without being wholly
conscious of what you are drawing.

To apply that philosophy to drawing, you simply have to realize: when
you are drawing a beak, you are drawing a beak; when you are drawing a
feathered head, you are drawing a feathered head. And that goes for any
of the hundreds, or will it be thousands, of separate parts you will be
called upon to draw. This may seem contrary to my usual preaching about
not drawing details in the gesture class. It is a matter of
sequence---first the rough gesture drawing, then the detail. The line
used to lay in the pose or action (acting) can be all one kind of line,
as long as it is flowing, expressive, flexible, searching, and basic.
The line to \"finalize\" the drawing must describe the shape, texture,
and malleability of each part. So when drawing a bird\'s beak, you
should aspire to make the drawing say \"beak.\" When you get to the
feathered part of the bird, you shift gears or press the, \"When I am
drawing feathers, I am drawing feathers\" button.

I fully realize the pressure levied on you by the production schedules,
but it really takes but a split second to alter your thinking as you
move from one texture or shape to another. Just being aware of what you
are drawing will help to elevate your line from \"lazy\" to
\"expressive.\"

Also notice that since the head is tilted to our left it sets up a
squash on that side and a stretch on the\
other side---and the contorted\
crown shape contributes to that\
very important animation g immick, squash and stretch. Even so, it\
remains rigid and must be drawn so as the surrounding hair and fles
hwork against it with their softness and of course, more extreme\
flexibility---soft and flexible n on-lazy-lines, that is.

Take the hair. Its basic shape
is![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image494.png)


In movement it never loses that basic appearance, but may squash and
stretch and overlap to enhance the head moves.

So, as you \"Zen\" your way through the drawing, you come to the face.
You say, now I am drawing the bridge of the nose:
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image495.png)
Now the top of the nose:

Now the front of the nose:

Now the part under the nostril:

 Now the top of the nostril:

Those are all separate parts of the face and must be kept in mind as you
are drawing them. If you think of all that as being just one big shape
it will end up as a lazy-line

If you are a \"lazy line\" person, all this will seem like an unbearable
burden, but if you love to draw, and can incorporate the \"When I am
drawing this, I am drawing this\" bit, your job of drawing will become
very meaningful. Sparks of enthusiasm will put a twinkle in your eyes
and a sparkle in your drawings.

**Double Vision**\
Try this experiment in a gesture drawing session. Find a production
model sheet of a cartoony character, and clip it to the top of your
drawing board where it will be visible at all times. Transfer the
gestures of the live model onto the production model.

This will give you an opportunity to break away altogether from copying
the details of the live model. Try to capture the pose the live model is
production model. Don\'t get involved in detail or "cleanup." At first
you may think this is a waste of a perfectly good live model, but as you
get with it, I think you'll find it to be a revelation. It might even
become addictive.

Do not attempt to copy anything on the live model except the gesture,
and do not try to copy anything specific off the model sheet---just
sketch in the most general terms.

Occasionally a bit of live action film is used as source material for
animation. Since it is impossible to find actors who are constructed
like the cartoon characters, the animator has to extract the essence of
the action from the film or Photostat and transfer that to the drawings.
It takes a kind of "double vision"---you are looking at the live action
but you are seeing the cartoon character. You may be looking at a person
seven heads tall but drawing a cartoon character three or four heads
tall. It requires a special knack---but it is a learnable knack.

In the early \'30s when the use of live action was first tried, it was a
period of discovery, a period of great excitement. That discovery is
history, and now each artist has to discover for themselves the merits
and even the necessity of using live action, whether in the form of live
models, film clips or Photostats. After all, all cartoon characters, no
matter how cartoony, are built on human traits or attributes.

Chapter 6: Pushing the Gesture

> Learning to see in this "double vision" can be fun. In their book *The
> Illusion of Life*, Ollie and Frank state, "And the spirit of fun and
> discovery was probably the most important element of that period."
> Don't let the statement, "that period" squelch your spirit of
> discovery, pursuit and involvement.

> Again I quote from the *The Illusion of Life*, "But whenever we stayed
> too close to the Photostats, or directly copied even a tiny piece of

Gesture Drawing For Animation

**Caricature**\
In drawing from the model, there is a tendency to draw the ideal figure,
the one that frequents the anatomy books and the ones we clip or Xerox
and pin up above our desks.

Instead, take advantage of the variety of subjects in your sketching
sessions. Capture those distinguishing features in your drawing. This
one has a large mid-section with a receding chin. This one is tall or
paunchy or lithe. His body tapers down to tiny ankles that seem
incongruously inadequate to carry the weight. This one is chunky, even
muscular, but dainty in movement---even graceful.

The same applies to heads. The model may have a pinched nose, a double
chin, baggy jowls, a long upper lip, beady eyes or a low forehead.

Should we not keep these things in mind rather than deltoids, ulnas and
the 7-heads tall syndrome? As Robert Henri said, "Seeing into the
realities---beyond the surfaces of the subject."

These are the things that help determine and emphasize the gesture. Even
as the structure of the body determines the possibilities and the
uniqueness of a gesture, so with the construction of the head and the
features of the face, especially if those features can be recognized and
caricatured.

Don Graham said, "It isn't how well we draw the joints or the different
parts of the anatomy, but how well you know where they are, how they
relate and how they work. That's the important thing." And as Woolie
Reitherman said, "Get the spirit of the thing. That's the most important
and then after that you can add to it." Ward Kimball said if he could
take something apart and put it back together again, he could draw it.
Perhaps we could approach drawing the head in that way. If we could
analyze the construction of the head, the types of features and the
meaning of the gesture, we could draw it.

In animation, the ideal model sheet is one that clearly describes the
head shape and the features. The proportions and types of features are
all defined and clearly recorded. It will even suggest, somewhat, the
extremes one might go to in animating that character. Even then, it is
not easy. And it is less easy with a live model. Here it is up to us to
discover the idiosyncrasies of that person and use them to reveal and
enhance the gesture. A\
reproduction of an anatomy book illustration will not do---no more than
it does for the model of one of our characters in a cartoon feature. The
basic structure will certainly be useful, but as for individual
character, each person is unique, and the gesture that comes from that
uniqueness is what we are striving for.

For the animation artist the ideal lies somewhere in that vast area
between\
realistic/anatomical and cartoon/caricature. Walt's definition of
caricature: "The true interpretation of caricature is the exaggeration
of an illusion of the actual, or the sensation of the actual put into
action." Eric Larson said, (see Eric Larson's lectures on\
caricature---copies available \[Ed. note: does anyone have a copy of
this?\]):

**28 Principles of Animation**\
There are some principles of animation that\
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image530.png)
drawing. It may seem mind
boggling---something like trying to corral a dozen frightened deer. But
once you get the knack, it\'s really quit a lot of fun.To illustrate
these principles, I have chosen a supposedly simple scene. When the
scene is analyzed, it is apparent how far one may go in using these
principles. The action in\
can be consciously used in any scene. I have\
listed 28 principles--- though there well may\
be more. Most of them apply to still drawing\
also---such as those made from a model.

Having 28 principles suggests that a hell of a\
lot of thinking and planning goes into a\
this scene is quite broad, making the principles easy to find, but they
should be applied to subtle scenes (actions) also. The use of held
drawings and moving holds can be very effective, but only if they
contain the vitality of an action drawing. Again, the use of these
principles makes that possible.

The purpose of studying and analyzing a scene like this is to acquaint
oneself with the possibilities in the use of the principles of
animation. At first these will have to be used consciously, then
hopefully in time will become second nature. These are the tools of
animation and should be incorporated whenever possible. Some of them may
be accidentally stumbled upon while animating in an emotional spurt. But
when the emotions are lax, knowing these principles will enable the
artist to animate his scene intellectually, logically and artistically
as well as emotionally.

Here's an example of the observations that might be made by flipping and
studying just the first two drawings. By shifting your eyes from one
drawing to the other you can see these things happening. Watch the
negative shapes change also.

To continue along this line of investigation, drawing 8 on the next page
would be called a "push off." Note that every line and shape on the
drawing helps the upward thrust. Even the tail, (which is still
following the path set up for it by its primary force, the rump) helps
by way of contrast and follow-thru. Pick any shape on the figure and
compare it to drawing 6 above. Note how each shape changes to enhance
the overall shape of the action---the neck, the chest, the legs the
back, and so on. Even though this is just one drawing, there is no doubt
about the action that is taking place in this part of the scene. This
should be true of any drawing in any scene (for that matter any drawing
done from the model).

Anatomy is essential to any drawing, whether it has a direct reference
to nature or is completely imaginary. Though a character and/or its
action may be greatly exaggerated or caricatured, anatomy in a real
sense remains fairly constant: an elbow is an elbow and only bends in a
certain way, and has its limitations. Liberties may be taken but the
"reality" of even a cartoon must be kept or it will lose credibility. It
is not an easy thing to convert one's knowledge of structural anatomy to
the cartoon medium.

It has been said that the location of a joint is more important than the
joint itself. For instance if an arm shape has been established, it
cannot have an elbow bend in an improbable place, no matter how well the
elbow is drawn. Compare Tigger's arm to that of a real tiger:\

Wow, did I go over 2,000 mark! About 4,350. But not to worry. When I
prepare for a competitive tennis match, I overload my body with burnable
calories to ensure lots of stamina.

And I tell you it\'s almost like cheating. After an hour or two of
intense exercise, the 30 year olds I play with are panting, and I have
energy to burn. So, let's make our drawings have energy to burn---not
tired looking, but perky and expressive. They should shout out to the
viewer, "I have gone all out on this pose, held nothing back, with no
fear of pooping out. I have given it all I've got, but with energy left
over for many more to come."

Knowledge is the thing it takes to plan the course, but energy is the
thing it takes to make it all happen. So, watch those calories.

Here are some high energy drawings. Study them for their use of the
above listed calories.

161

Gesture Drawing For Animation

be an overwhelming obsession to produce a drawing that says "woman
opening umbrella."

Even after accepting the fact of the center of interest, the battle has
just begun, and the shortest route to victory is the use of all the
rules of drawing: perspective, tension, angles, rhythm, squash and
stretch, etc. Every single line should support the theme and help accent
the thrust of the action. The feeling of motion, that is the building up
of physical action to reach that climax of the pose can be conjured up
mentally and will serve as a previous animation extreme to "flip" from
in order to reach a dynamic extreme\
drawing---one that says, for instance, \"woman opening umbrella.\"

But whatever the prop or whatever the action, there is a story to be
told, and a prop definitely suggests a theme. A story sketch man usually
has only one drawing to describe a scene---he must choose one that will
illustrate the story point. If an umbrella is involved, you can be sure
he will construct a sketch featuring an umbrella. The story men and the
director could care less about how much the story sketch man knows about
anatomy or detail drawing, as long as the story point is getting across.

There comes a time in an author's career when he transcends the
obsession to get the proper amount of verbs and adjectives and
prepositions into a sentence and concentrates on telling his story in an
interesting, absorbing, stimulating, arresting, striking, attractive,
appealing, entertaining way.

The artist (animator), (you) have the same *raison d'etre*.

163

happens nearly every time something is stretched. You might say nothing
ever happens without influencing something else. The closer the
"something else" is to the primary action the more it will be
influenced.

For instance let's take a row of lines:

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image559.png)


And pull the one on the right to the right:

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image560.png)


In searching out ways of using the principles of animation such as
squash and stretch, one should think of animating an object or character
rather than merely moving it. Even in your mind\'s eye, there is a
difference between looking at an action as opposed to seeing an action.

Another way to put it: Watching an action as opposed to experiencing an
action.

In the book *Inner Tennis* the author speaks about "Riding the Ball."
It's a psychological thing---it causes one to think of taking part in
the hitting of the ball and in its flight, as opposed to just hitting
the ball and letting it go anywhere it pleases. These are all just
different ways of saying, in true Zen fashion, animate the action as if
you were it.

**The Opposing Force**\
Every move we make has two elements: *anticipation* and *opposing
force*. These elements are sometimes almost imperceptibly subtle;
sometimes wildly exaggerated.

Here is an example of an opposing force. Bernard starting out in a part
squash pose, then opening his arms outward and his head upward all in
opposing directions. (Note the tangent of the tail and hand in the first
and second drawing---not good):

And yet another:

> ![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image567.png)


These are all gestures we use in different degrees during our daily
living. Slightly, in ordinary circumstances, more exaggeratedly when
mimicking or telling a story, and greatly magnified when animating. Go
back over these examples and study how the solid-flex parts of the body
(see Chapter Three) were employed in order to execute those movements.
Work your eyes from drawing to drawing observing the use of angle
against angle, squash against stretch, close proximity to openness.

**Connecting Actions**\
For the action study's sake, forget the realism and go for the action. I
say action rather than pose because although we use poses in animation,
every pose is in reality an action.

No one ever just does nothing, especially in animation. If there is a
pose it is either because something has just happened or is about to
happen. If something funny has just happened, give the audience an
additional thrill by ending up with a funny pose. If something is about
to happen, give the audience that superior feeling that they have
figured out that something is about to happen. In true life, the wheels
of the mind turn undetected by observers; in cartoons that thinking
process has to be caricatured. The story line takes care of a lot of
that but the bulk of it is done visually. That is why we have such broad
anticipations, "takes," squashes and stretches, arcs, slow-ins and
slow-outs, followthroughs and overlaps, and long moving holds where you
want to build up to some situation or let down from one---some pose you
want to "milk" for all its worth.

So for the purposes of studying life drawing for animation, one pose
does not tell enough, because seldom will the animator be faced with
just a one pose scene. So ideally there should be at least three poses
to study and portray each action:

1\. The Preparation -- telling the audience something is going to
happen, 2. The Anticipation -- gathering the forces to carry through
with the action, and 3. The Action -- carrying out of the intended
action.

Plus, of course, all the follow-through, overlap and resulting
residuals---dust, smoke, wind, destroyed property, chaos\... whatever.

Another aid when inbetweening a particular shape is be conscious of
these things: note the angle, length, width, over all shape of the
extremes and keep these things in mind while drawing.

For instance if you have a shape like this to inbetween:

> ![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image572.png)


First of all establish the angle of the extremes and indicate a n
inbetween angle lightly on your paper.

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image573.png)
\
Then establish the length of the extremes and indicate the inbetween
length on your paper with a couple of dots:\
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image574.png)


Then starting at one of the dots proceed to draw the inbetween with its
width and over all shape, plus any subtleties constantly in mind,
drawing your way to the other dot.

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image575.png)
\
Then add the details. This may seem mind boggling but is really quite
simple. Once the procedure is learned and becomes second nature, it is
much faster and much more accurate than floundering amidst a maze of
confusing lines---with a hesitant approach---with stops and starts, \"a
little drawing here, a little drawing there\" technique with its
enervating and time consuming meanderings. And soon all of this can be
handled with a minimum of consternation---even on a Monday!

This calls for an arc to assure a smooth flow from one drawing to
another:

Meaning the inbetweens 15, 19 and 23 should follow the arc:

If they were merely inbetweened the action would be jerky:

Try to swing your arm or move your head like that and you will see how
important it is to establish the arcs before attempting a drawing.

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image582.png)

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image584.png)


Another consideration is timing: Again, whether there is a chart on the
extreme or not, one should check to be sure.

Actions are full of slow-outs:
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image585.png)
\
And slow-ins:
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image586.png)


Slow-outs occur when a character or a part of a character, having been
still, begins to move. It will not take off like a bullet out of a gun,
it has to start slowly and gain speed. At the other end of the action it
will slow-in, meaning it can not just stop abruptly but must ease into
the pose.

And if they are not heeded, the action will lose its snap. Rolling
several extremes on the pegs will reveal any need for slow-in or
slow-out consideration. It takes but a moment to check for arcs and
slow-ins, but in the long run may save either later rework or avoid a
possible not-too-crisp movement. If there is any question about whether
or not to do this on your own, discuss it with the animator. He will be
pleased that you have shown an interest.

Any \"follow through\" on clothing (sleeves, coat tails, dress hems,
ties) long hair, tails, ears, etc. will involve slow-outs and slow-ins.
For instance when a character with a long tail comes to a halt after a
move, the body may go into trace backs (or a held cel when permissible)
while the tail eases into its final position, perhaps many frames later.

Gesture Drawing For Animation

When I was young, studying drawing was difficult. The studios where I
worked didn\'t have life classes, so I copied drawings from anatomy
books and illustrations from magazines. In those days the magazines ran
a lot of stories that were profusely illustrated by some A-1 artists:
Mario Cooper, Harvey Dunne, Peter Helck, Wallace Morgan, etc. But
somehow it wasn\'t jelling. I couldn\'t seem to connect with the
drawings, and with my memory, it was hard to remember what I had copied
and why. It wasn\'t until I got interested in caption cartooning that my
study began to make sense. Why? Because I had a story to put over (a
gag). Now if I had a difficult or special gesture to draw, I made many
sketches and did some research having a goal. It was that sense of story
that fired me up and enabled me to grapple with gestural problems.
Anatomy, size relationships and bodily movements seemed to fall into
place.

Now I encourage students to have a one drawing story in mind as they
draw from the model so the essence of that story will project itself
into their drawing.

Recently we enjoyed a session where the students took turns being the
model. It\'s good for them to experience that side of classroom drawing.
It also provides many different characters to draw. I urged the students
to be aware of the differences: tall, short; thin, plump; male, female;
husky, frail, etc. I supplied several props each could choose for their
two short poses. I encouraged them to \"hang loose,\" that is, draw
loosely and expressively; to concentrate on story, rather than on making
a photographic copy of the models.

The spirit of this concept caught on like wildfire. As you will see in
the several drawings that I remembered to \"confiscate,\" the students
called up some reserve energy and went straight to the essence of the
story, even adding a little of their own imagination. Check out these
fabulous drawings by David Pimentel and Whitney Martin:

However the student shifted the hips and legs over to the left, even
beyond the axis with the head, which canceled out the lean. Also he drew
a straight right arm, which would indicate a stretch, but with the right
shoulder lowered, a stretch would put the hand down below the knees.
Even if he is using that arm to support the lean it would bend to
suggest the feeling of squash on that side, as I have indicated in my
sketch. His left shoulder is high so causes a stretch/tension from
shoulder to hip. (I omitted the left arm to feature that stretch). I
also corrected the problem of the parallel lower legs, which helped the
feeling of spreading the legs apart, which naturally occurs when you
want to make room for an object being held there (no matter how small
the object is).

In regard to a sense of story, I picture this sea captain as showing off
or acting in front of his crew, letting them know how manly, debonair,
masterly, self-confident he is. In other words how captain-like he is,
even while just resting. Artist, actor, writer, director,
whatever---should have a pretty good idea of the character he is
portraying. In the gesture drawing class we have models that suggest a
character, but the artist has the opportunity to fine-tune it to suit
his or her own liking. An artist, other than myself, may have chosen a
captain who hates the sea, is sticking by the rail because he\'s going
to be sick; maybe he\'s gruff and boisterous, a tyrant; maybe he\'s an
inbetweener having his picture taken at a carnival photo booth.

In this next pose, the model was opening an umbrella. That would require
one shoulder up on the pulling up side, the other shoulder down on the
pushing down side. Sounds normal, doesn\'t it?

![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image609.png)

\
But you see, this gal is just like the sea captain in that she wants
everyone to know she can work this gadget with expertise, élan, grace,
and in proper kinesthetic mastery. In other words, she\'s playacting.
She has to bend over to push down on that left arm, and any time you
bend over from the waist your fanny protrudes. (Stand up and try it).
And though that area may be partly hidden, as in this case, you must
draw the feeling that this is happening, that the legs are connected to
the hips and the knees are bent for\
stabilization. If you call forth your sense of kinesthesia, these
problems will disappear in a flurry of joyful and expressive drawing:

Gesture Drawing For Animation

A \"shifting of mental gears\" took place. What an eye opener! Singing
suddenly took on a whole new meaning. I was able to put aside the
concern with voice (anatomy) and began concentrating on telling the
message and meaning of the music. So, what\'s all this got to do with
drawing? This you are telling a story in drawing, and you want to tell
it in the most enjoyable and creative way you can. You don\'t want to
burden your viewers with how much you know or don\'t know about anatomy
or how well you draw belts and dress seams. Just tell the story with
simple, easy-to-read gesture drawings.

Some years ago I took a modern painting class at Valley College. The
instructor,\
Danielli, told the class on the first night, \"Anyone who wants to paint
dew drops on roses, don\'t bother to come back.\" I accepted that as a
challenge, painted a rose with a dew drop on it and brought it to the
next session. He said, \"That\'s nice---very tasteful, but I don\'t want
any \'taste\' in this class.\" I said, \"What? I\'ve spent 40 years
trying to acquire taste and now you tell me \'no taste\'.\" He said,
\"You\'ve been trying to turn people \'on\', now I want you to try to
turn them \'off\'.\"

That may sound very anti-social but taken in its proper sense, he was
telling me to relax---quit trying to force my paintings into some
preconceived mold. We\'re going to try to be \"creative\" in this class.
We\'re not going to \"copy\" the old dewdrops-on-roses thing. We\'re
going to abstract the essences of color and shape and mood and design
from nature release ourselves from the old conventional ways of painting
a picture.

The effect on me was phenomenal. I felt a great weight fall from my
back. I am still, 29 years later, impressed by that lesson.

Recently the people in the drawing class were starting off very stiffly,
bearing down on tightly gripped pencils, trying to trace the model\'s
anatomical physique. I pleaded with them to stop trying to \"draw\" the
model. They were drawing the muscles, drawing the head, drawing the
arms, etc. I had them grasp the pencil farther up the shank, releasing
themselves of all the responsibilities of drawing the model. \"Let the
pencil do the drawing,\" I said. \"Allow it to search out the
gesture\... allow it to tell the story.\"

What followed was a joy to see. I have reproduced one of the artist\'s
work here to show how quickly and thoroughly he got the idea. This was
not a slow transition---it happened on the very next drawing, and
continued for the rest of the session. The first two drawings are
representative of his first sketches. They are rather stiff, frozen, and
seem to be an attempt to tell the viewer how the model was built. The
ones following are expressive, loose, graceful, and tell the viewer in
an interesting way, what the model was doing.

It\'s tough having to come up with some nice drawings after having
become tired and tight from drawing exacting line drawings all day. But
here\'s where the mental part of it enters in. To continue in the same
vein will further tire you. What is needed is some form of release that
will be exhilarating and liberating. Again, one of my favorite phrases,
a \"shifting of the mental gears\" into a different mode which will be
rewarding both as a study period and for some wholesome relaxation. Try
to forget \"singing\" (drawing) to the audience---just tell the story.

simply because that\'s how they appeared on the model or on the model
sheet, or in the anatomy book. Many struggle so doggedly with the
construction and the detail that they miss the gesture.

Why are we so hesitant, so reluctant, or tentative to manipulate the
character to suit the needs of the story? The human figure is extremely
pliable, even capable of contortion.

I\'m not advocating contortion, but I am trying to promote thinking and
acting.

The very first stages of a drawing will tell where your thinking is. If
you are thinking story---that will begin to emerge in the first few
lines drawn. Many times in the evening class, artists will carry a
drawing to an advanced stage yet have no clue as to what the story
behind the pose is (the most important thing in a drawing). Here\'s a
drawing that I intercepted at a stage where I thought the artist should
have been well into the story. He (or she) has perhaps 75 lines drawn
and you still can\'t tell what\'s going on. To make my point, I sketched
in what was happening in about 10 lines:\
![](vertopal_9517037717b34904a613f2ce2e3d14dc/media/image619.png)
\
To arouse that sense of urgency to get the essence down, I often ask the
class to imagine they are running to board a train---which is about to
leave the station. They see someone in a delightful pose which they have
just got to sketch, so out comes the sketchbook. At that moment the
conductor calls, \"ALL ABOARD,\" and so they have just enough time to
get the barest essence of the pose. If they get the essence down, then
tomorrow it can be reconstructed---but if the essence is not there in
the sketch\--forget it.

Here\'s a nice little essence drawing by Dan Boulos. Just a few
lines---dashed off in bravura fashion. A common, everyday gesture told
in a very delicate and expressive way:

Here\'s another one. Two guys shaking hands. The one on the left is all
excited---he hasn\'t seen his friend in ages. He is exuberantly pumping
away, head tucked down, shoulders up---positively gushing. He is leaning
forward at the waist, as if bowing. He is\
demonstrative but respectful. The other chap is a little more hesitant,
saying, perhaps, \"Oh, hi\...,\" but thinking, \"Do I know him?\" The
man on the left is the initiator of this action---the one on the right
is reacting. He reaches out in involuntary response but the rest of him
displays caution:

See what fun drawing can be?

In an article on the author Reynolds Price, (L.A. Times, Wed., May 2) it
stated that he \"\...has respect for the [tradition of storytelling,
which he ranks after food as man\'s]{.ul} [principle need]{.ul}---sex
and shelter being relatively expendable.\" I underlined the words I want
you to remember, lest your attention be deflected by other thoughts in
that sentence.

You, as animation cartoonists/artists, should acknowledge that
storytelling is also one of your principle needs. Not only for your job
but for yourself. You should surrender to the delights of expressing
yourself in drawing. If you don\'t feel that need now---you should
expose yourself to more dramatizing, even if only in the form of books,
movies, and plays, thus creating a desire to express those things.

I\'m a \"frustrated actor\" who has spent many an hour on the stage. But
now I get my kicks by doing my acting/storytelling on paper or canvas.
You don\'t have to be an actor, but

Gesture Drawing For Animation

In our sessions we emphasize the mood and emotional part of the
gestures. Needless to say both areas are necessary for a maximum of
expression. But whereas the mechanical part of anatomy is traditionally
taught in anatomy classes, the mental and emotional side has been left
for the artist to develop according to the artists\' needs or
preference. Ultimately in animation one must face up to the emotional
gesture when called upon by the director to interject it into his
scenes.

As and example of the marriage of the physical and mental, take the
breaking of a vase. The physical act of breaking a base can be
accomplished by simply dropping the vase on a hard surface. But to show
the emotional reason for breaking the vase would require the artist to
imagine himself in such an angry state that would cause him to break it,
and get that feeling into the drawings. Each artist would have his own
subtle manner of doing it but basically there is a sort of universal
body language that says \"anger.\"

There is no doubt that there is a physical universe, but we deal with it
in a mental and emotional way. A physical being without emotions would
make a lousy roommate. Nor would a scene of one of our characters
perfectly drawn but without some mental\
motivation be of help to the picture. A roughly drawn scene, off model
but containing the essence of the storyline would be much more
desirable. Then let the one who draws so well clean the scene up---but
retaining all the emotional gesture so vital to the making of a good
Disney film.

One night we had an excellent model named Lalla, who acts out little
one-pose dramas.

Lalla\'s pose showed a woman in mental and physical agony. One student
was making a beautiful drawing that looked like a woman in repose. I
said, \"Yours is a nice drawing but that pose is a Käthe Kollwitz
situation.\" He said, \"Who is Käthe Kollwitz?\" She was a Prussian
artist who grew up in a period of much conflict. She lived in Germany
during Hitler\'s rise to power, and depicted the tragedies and
sufferings of the period.

Gesture Drawing For Animation

There are some non-verbal messages that are "universal". These are basic
human emotions such as joy, sorrow, anger, tenderness, submission,
domination, fear, surprise, distress, disgust, contempt, and shame. It
seems these emotions are tied in with the physiological structure of
humans. Some scientists (who study kinesics) believe that the brains of
all humans are programmed to react bodily in a similar fashion to these
emotions.

Other forms of body language are either learned by copying, or by strict
codes or rules devised by individual cultures. Often these gestures are
the exact opposite from those of other cultures. For instance, nodding
the head is our western culture's non-verbal way of saying "yes." There
are societies in India, however, where a nod of the head means "no".

Messages of the body are used to establish one's "space," of which there
are many kinds---personal, social, public, territorial, etc. Body
language is used to reveal one's social position, one's attitude, and
one's needs; also there are gestures of love, friendship, and hatred.
Gestures are used to create an "image" of self as honest (watch the
candidates on TV), or sexy, or physical or caring, etc. The kinds of
gestures and their uses are practically limitless. Every gesture we make
or contrive is used to explain our thoughts or actions, and the degree
to which we display the movements establishes our character as extrovert
or introvert, aggressive or passive, thoughtful or insensitive, comical
or tragic.

In animation, of course, the story and its characters dictate the types
of gestures needed. In most cases whatever the character, caricaturing
the action is necessary to "punch" the business. Caricature is the
animator's means of making sure there is no doubt in the viewer\'s mind
what is being portrayed. John Lounsbery animated what he thought was a
cute Italian gesture for Tony, the waiter, in *Lady and the Tramp*. The
director, Geronimi, knowledgeable in Italian matters, suggested he
change it---it happened to be an obscene gesture.

Poetry can, for instance, be nebulous and suggestive in order to evoke
personal images in the mind of the reader, but a cartoon has to "read"
in an instant---with no need for retrogression. In a film, everything
unfolds at 24 frames a second and all must be "spelled out" so everyone
arrives at the ending at the same time and with the same conclusion.

Gestures that "ring true" are needed to attain that goal. Practice,
observation, constant sketching, "osmosis", and even emulation of the
Disney masters past and present should be among your daily pursuits.

Drawing gestures is like using body language - it requires the context
of an entire situation (story) to be thoroughly meaningful.

We learn drawing by studying parts; we practice drawing by assembling
those parts into a meaningful whole.

Here are some drawings from Joe Ranft's sketchbook, done recently on a
trip to Australia. They are what I call "unselfconscious" gesture
drawings. As you study them you will see that there was no attempt to
impose upon them any more than that they

And here is a pose with lots of tension in it. The artist knows his
anatomy; that is, how to draw arms, legs, waists, hips, etc., but failed
to work those parts into what was a very expressive pose. Notice that he
straightened up the body; made the hands, buttocks, knees, and feet
horizontally parallel:

As you can see, anatomy is not the
answer---*acting* is. If anatomy were the answer, an actor could go out
on the stage and just stand there---naked. The inner motivations that
power a person\'s body to express body language are what it\'s all
about. Anatomy is what is on the outside---motivation is the driving
force within. That\'s what the gesture classes and these handouts are
for---to whet your desire to go beyond just an anatomical drawing (or a
copy of the model); to foment a lifelong desire to express readable
emotions in your drawings; to stimulate your inner forces to take over
and rule the outer. May the INNER FORCE be with you!

191

Gesture Drawing For Animation

needs potentials? I'll tell you who needs them---you do, I do. This
world was created by some creative energy (you name it as you see fit)
and that creative energy that founded it and now runs it, is working, in
and through you now. Do you not feel that surge of energy and awareness
tingling at your finger tips and its motor humming away in your solar
plexus? Is your mind not spinning with thoughts, ideas? Is it not always
searching, searching, searching?

The awareness of it will be strongest in the springtime when the earth
around you begins to hum with the renewal of life. But here's the
wonderful thing---man's renewal is not dependent on springtime. A mere
rededication to creativity is all man needs to start the creative juices
flowing and then suddenly there is the energy---energy that seems to
feed upon itself, so that each moment becomes a fresh start, each
experience a new event, and the vision is forward-looking with
anticipation and wonder---not backward looking, full of regrets for
neglected opportunities of the past, or negative influences that creep
in and block our vision.

Yes, the action is drawing and the preparation is aligning ourselves
with that creative energy, becoming a channel through which it can find
expression. Think of the universe as being full of energy (it is, you
know) and that energy is swirling around us waiting to take on some
form. All we have to do is open up our consciousness and allow it to
enter---and in a way that no one else in the world can, express it.

**Osmosis**\
Positive thinking comes in many forms. One of the more potent and
effective forms is subliminal input. Glen Keane was pinning up some
inspirational drawings in his room one day as I happened by. He
explained that he hoped that some of the artist\'s genius would enter
him through osmosis. Glen laughed, but he was serious. And serious he
has a right to be, for osmosis works.

The conscious mind must be selective of the things that vie for one\'s
attention because it can only process one thing at a time. You could
liken it to a telephone line where the voice travels over a single
concentrated vehicle. The conscious mind \"listens in\" to whatever it
desires to pay attention. The subconscious mind, however, receives an
unbroken deluge of information, not through a single line but more like
radio waves which travel in all directions. The subconscious mind
receives constantly, from all directions, all the information picked up
by the five senses (and psychically) in the form of subliminal
\"osmosis\".

Most everyone is acquainted with the classic example where subliminal
advertisements for coke and popcorn were flashed on the screen
periodically during the film. Later, some fellow capitalized on the
method by recording several tapes of a positive thinking and self help
nature, but with only the sound of waves breaking at the sea shore being
audible.

The person seeking help listens for an hour a day (or something like
that) and while the conscious mind is soothed by the wave sounds, the
subconscious deals with the subliminal suggestions in its mysterious but
inevitable fashion.

plug along, each at our own pace, some eager and industrious in
improving ourselves --some of us sit back and wait for the "light" to
come on. Some of us are driven by some invisible urge to create. Others
of us need some project imposed on us from outside us to stir us into
action.

Animation has a unique requirement in that its rewards are vaguely
rewarding and at the same time frustrating. We are performers but our
audience is hidden from us. We are actors but there is no applause. We
are artists but our works are not framed and hung on walls for friends
to see. We are sensitive people whose sensibility is judged across the
world in dingy theaters by a sometimes popcorn eating audience. Yet we
are called upon day by day to delve deep into our psyche and come up
with fresh creative bits of entertaining fare. That requires a special
kind of discipline and devotion, and enthusiasm. Our inner dialogue must
be amply peppered with encouraging argument. We sometimes have to invent
or create an audience in our minds to draw for.

Our fellow artists only partially serve us in that respect. We go to
them for criticism not for praise. The directors are necessarily
merciless. We at times almost connive rather than create to get a scene
by them. I used to sing in operettas, concerts, etc., so I know what
real applause is. It is heavenly. A living audience draws something
extra out of the performer. A stage director once said to the cast of a
play on the opening night, "You've had good equipment to work with: a
theatre with everything it takes to put on a show. But you have been
handicapped---one essential thing has been denied you. Tonight there's
an audience out there; now you have everything you need."

Well, we do have an awaiting audience out there. We'll be denied the
applause but at least there is a potential audience to perform for; one
to keep in mind constantly as we day by day shape up our year dress
rehearsal. Even as we struggle with the myriad difficulties of
finalizing a picture---what is the phrase, "getting it in the can," we
can perform each act for that invisible or mystical audience. We can't
see our audience but it is real and it is something to work for.

So, all you beautiful people, if you are the kind that needs a little
mental manipulation to keep your creative juices flowing, perhaps this
has been of some benefit; if not, well, so be it.

**Mental and Physical Preparation**\
I would be amiss if I didn\'t mention mental attitude or physical well
being, along with some possible means of acquiring and/or maintaining
it. Much recent research has proven the benefits of pursuing such a
program.

All of us have experienced periods of diminished energy and depression.
It is possible to have one or both of them creep upon us so slowly that
we are unaware of the change, and there we are, dragging our (mental and
physical) feet. Over a period of time we may even come to believe that
this is the way life is supposed to be. You\'ve heard people when asked,
\"How are you?\" answer, \"Okay\", meaning of course, not bad enough to
say \"Lousy,\" and not good enough to say \"Terrific.\"

You as artists don't have bands playing, banners flying, cheerleaders or
a friendly crowd of admirers to bring you up to creative heights. But
you can have a quiet, affirmative, efficacious word with yourself daily,
to make sure all your wheels are on the track.

**Habits**\
Arguments against forming daily habits that guide you through life
without having make any new choices are quite numerous. The old adage
\"use it or lose it\" is applicable here. If one has formed pretty solid
days worth of habits that carry him through the days and months and
years---he is going to grow smaller and smaller as age sets and the more
habitual he is the sooner age will set in.

Someone said, \"Change will help keep the balance sheets in order,\" or
something like that. We\'re not talking change for the sake of
change---but for improvement. For\
expanding the consciousness, for an ever fresh and open-minded attitude
to your piece of the universe. Habits are a blessing when they relieve
us of the burden of having to relearn everything we do every day. But if
they lead us down the narrowing road of\
complacency, they become a drag.

> That great teacher and the great guy, T. Hee, told his students to be
> like a sponge---soak up all the knowledge and information you can.
> Never allow yourself to get into a selfsatisfied or complacent state.
> He advised never to drive home from work by the same streets twice.
> Take alternate routes---observe the new houses, trees, gardens, and
> don\'t just drive by them---look at them, see them. When walking along
> a sidewalk, look into the store windows, not just a glance, but a good
> look, to see what\'s there---the set up, the merchandise, the signs.

> Stop everything and just listen. There are some delightful Irish and

> **Final Words on Essence**\
> The essence thing appears in all the arts not sketching. In literature

> In music it is when it goes beyond just notes and lyrics---when there
> exists an essence that touches the heart. There are only 26 letters in
> our alphabet---only a couple hundred words we use in daily
> communication, but it is the artful way those are juxtaposed that sets
> them apart as memorable and\
> meaningful. In drawing you have 360 degrees in which to vary your
> lines and the choice and variance determines whether or not your
> drawing will be worthy of the effort you've spent on it.

There used to be the belief that certain muses attended the
inspirational needs of the artist. Nowadays we speak of using the right
side of the brain. Certain metaphysical teachings speak of expanded
consciousness or awareness.

In Psalm I it says the man whose delight is in the law of the Lord ...
whatever he does prospers. Whatever---it is a shifting of the mental
gears from the ordinary to the inspired area of creativity. Here are a
few bars of Mozart. How can anything so beautiful be put down so simply?
When it's played by a good pianist it sounds like an ethereal orchestra
playing God's own Symphony.

It all starts with preparation, which is the "open sesame" of all
genius. Even the geniuses admit it's 99% hard work and 1% genius.

Ollie Johnston has done some of the most sensitive animation drawings
the Disney studio has seen. I gave him the title of, "Mr. Essence Man".
