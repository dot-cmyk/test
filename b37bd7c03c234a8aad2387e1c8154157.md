> **Foreword by the Editor**
>
> Walt Stanchfield was an animator who taught life drawing classes for
> animators with a special emphasis on gesture drawing. For each weekly
> class session, he wrote informal handouts to emphasize the theme of
> the current class session, to comment on work done in the previous
> class, or discuss whatever topic struck his fancy. Over a period of
> years, these notes were lovingly shared, studied, and treasured by
> animators and animation students everywhere.
>
> Mr. Stanchfield personally gave copies of his collection to interested
> students, and was happy to seem them distributed. According to many
> people who were lucky enough to study under him, he wanted to publish
> them as a book, but the studio where he worked was not interested.
>
> The goal of this project is to imagine the book that Walt Stanchfield
> might have written.
>
> This project is a compilation of the first 60 handouts that are shared
> on the [www.animationmeat.com](http://www.animationmeat.com/) website
> (as that site has numbered them). Walt Stanchfield did not present his
> topics in any particular order, which suited the ongoing nature of the
> classes. Walt\'s handouts are like individual frames of
> animation---some are extremes, some are inbetweens, some are even
> cleanups. As I was reading the notes and trying to absorb as much as I
> could, I thought I might understand them better if it were all laid
> out in sequence, with basic topics followed by more complex ideas. I
> wanted to see his ideas grouped by subject so I could compare the
> ideas. In other words, I wanted the topics to be arranged like a
> normal book. So I\'ve re-arranged bits and pieces from the handouts
> into cohesive chapters, while taking the liberty to eliminate
> redundancy and make minor edits just as a book editor would.
>
> In deciding how to organize the material, I imagined how Walt himself
> would have put it together if he\'d written it. Where would he have
> started? Knowing that the readers of the book would not be the lucky
> members of his classes, what concepts would have illustrated before
> moving on to more advanced topics? I tried to follow the principles
> Walt himself outlines in these notes: clarity, attention to the
> \"essence,\" emotion, and using the minimum number of words (lines) to
> get the point across.
>
> Another reason I wanted to see this material as a book is that there
> is no other book that covers the same information. There are many
> excellent volumes on animation, but they generally assume that the
> reader can already draw animatable characters with strong poses
> without explaining how to get to that stage. All the books on generic
> figure and life drawing, even those that emphasize gesture, encourage
> capturing the model\'s appearance and gesture without explaining how
> to internalize the gesture so as to push it to extremes or apply it to
> a different figure. Personally, I think this compilation---if it were
> a book--- would take its place among the top volumes on animation.
>
> There is an informal, lively charm to the original handouts that gives
> the reader a sense of \'being there.\' You may want to check them out
> to get a feel for how this information was
>
> originally presented. I\'ve left \"Savvy Sayings\" (\#47 in the
> animationmeat.com collection) out of this book, so it remains a
> delight that you can seek out on your own.
>
> Many, many thanks to Jon Hooper and Steve Kellener of
> AnimationMeat.com for scanning and transcribing many of Walt\'s notes
> and making them available on their Web site. This book incorporates
> their scans and OCR conversions, so it would not exist without their
> efforts. Thanks also to Aimee Major Steinberger, who was, I believe,
> the first person to post one of the Walt\'s notes on the Internet.

> Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, The Rescuers, The Fox and the Hound
> (coordinating animator), Micky\'s Christmas Carol (creative
> collaboration), The Black Cauldron (key animation coordinator), The
> Great Mouse Detective (coordinating animator), Roger Rabbit (animation

### From the October 2000 Peg-Board

> Once in a lifetime, a truly special teacher comes along who can change
> your life forever. To me and to many, many of our colleagues in the
> industry, Walt Stanchfield was that very special teacher.
>
> Part artist, part poet, part musician, part tennis pro, part eccentric
> savant, part wizened professor, Walt inspired a generation of young
> artists not only with his vast understanding of the animator\'s craft,
> but with his enthusiasm and love of life.
>
> Walt started in the animation industry at Mintz in 1937. He also
> worked for two years at Lantz. In 1948 he went to work for Disney and
> with the exception of four short retirements, had worked there ever
> since. Walt worked on every full-length cartoon feature from The
> Adventures of Ichabod Crane and Mr. Toad (1949) to The Great Mouse
> Detective (1986).
>
> Throughout those years Walt developed an insatiable enthusiasm for
> teaching the craft. He supported his numerous drawing classes with
> weekly hand-outs that taught not only animation and drawing
> principles, but philosophy, attitude and life lessons.
>
> Walt\'s personal work was full of vitality. He was a tireless
> sketcher, a painter of landscapes, seascapes, still lifes and people.
> He was an avid writer, penning hundreds of pages of notes about the
> art of animation as well as poetry and stories. He also loved music
> and spent an inordinate amount of time at the piano - that is, between
> caring for his vegetable garden and playing his most beloved game:
> tennis.
>
> Walt has touched many lives, not only with his endless enthusiasm for
> animation but with his love of life, art and people. His work will
> live on forever in the hands and hearts of his students and we will
> all miss him.

# *Introduction (In the Words of Walt Stanchfield)*

> Have you ever said, "Oh, if I could just draw well"? Ah, yes, you
> could express yourself to the *n*th degree. You could animate or
> cleanup scenes that would evoke *oohs* and *aahs*. Work wouldn't be so
> much like work.
>
> You could get it all down on paper and leave at 5:00 o'clock feeling
> good.
>
> Sometimes I wish I had a magic wand that I could wave over you and
> say, "You are now learned artists---go and draw to your hearts
> content." But maybe it's better that you do it yourself---become your
> own self-starter. The learning process should be fun. One thing that
> it does is it tears down a lot of false pride. To seek help is a
> humbling experience, a very necessary one, in as much as animation
> should be thought of and practiced as a group effort. I consider a
> person who is not ashamed to seek help a wise person.
>
> I got a late start in life. The first five or six years in the
> business were a "walk through." (I started at Mintz's Cartoon Studio
> on Sept. 13, 1937.) I was a dilettante, toying with poetry, painting,
> singing and socializing. Then 10 years as Lounsbery's assistant, and
> 10 years as Johnston's assistant helped me to "center" myself. Those
> guys worked hard and were completely devoted to their jobs. That
> taught me to work hard (and study hard to catch up). The next 20 years
> were not easy but were very satisfying.
>
> Having been brought out of retirement for the fourth time, I have been
> trying to impart some of the drawing know how I have gathered in these
> past years. I have incorporated the weekly "handout" which I think
> works better than lectures. They allow me to more thoroughly express
> the salient points that come to mind. What's more, they are
> "collectables" that, in the future may be reviewed when the need
> arises.
>
> These handouts allow me to delve deep into my experiences and
> observations and come up with something that may be of help to you. I
> have concentrated on gesture drawing because that is one of the
> foundations of good animation. Necessary to good gesture drawing are
> acting, caricature, anatomy, body language, perspective, etc., so from
> time to time these topics are isolated and discussed.
>
> At times I even play the "guru" and deliver a sermon of a positive
> thinking nature.
>
> I have struggled to avoid referring to myself as a \"teacher\" and
> have used words like \"suggestion\" rather than \"correction\" when
> offering another version of a pose. I\'m really here just to share my
> experience and it\'s your prerogative to treat it however you see fit.
> As for the suggestions, they are only to encourage you to see in new
> ways, to help you break any stultifying habits of \"penny-pinching\"
> seeing. I feel that the classes I conduct and the handouts, if nothing
> else, create a surge of group energy that you might tap for your own
> personal betterment.
>
> I once told the class, \"These things I present are not esoteric
> concepts.\" But I was wrong---they are. They are things that only the
> chosen few absorb. It is the \"chosen\" few
>
> that lead the way and accomplish the \"academy-award-worthy\"
> animation and drawing. But it is my conviction that by earnest
> pursuit, anyone can be of that group. It\'s just a matter of exposing
> oneself to some vehicle that will help one break the \"sound barrier\"
> (actually, thought barrier, for drawing is a thinking person\'s art).
>
> Here\'s a caricature by Dan Haskett that captured the spirit of my
> \"Teaching\" many years ago at the \"Disney School of Animation\".
> It\'s quite a prophetic drawing too, for out in the audience are two
> of your current directors - Clements and Musker. Spot any others?
>
> Maybe Jerry Reeves? Ed Gombert? Bluth, Pomeroy and Goldman? Even the
> artist himself is there - Dan Haskett.
>
> Different faces out there now but the sentiments are the same.

> "They studied line drawing, training on Holbein, Degas, Daumier, Da
> Vinci; they watched drapery in movement, noting the difference between
> filmy scarves, woolen skirts, flowing capes, and even baggy pants;
> they learned the value of a sharp, crisp line against a large, soft
> shape; they knew how to keep a design in the free-flowing changing
> shapes of animation rather than make a rigid copy. They always
> extended the arcs of the movement, squashed the characters more,
> stretched him more -- refining while emphasizing both the action and
> the drawings. They understood the business of the scene, what it was
> supposed to achieve, worked closely with the animator in deciding
> which parts were developing well and which parts needed a little help,
> and they could see the characters start to live as they "rolled" the
> drawings on the pegs. This required a special kind of talent as well
> as study -- not every artist could master it."
>
> So you see, there is something special about the thinking that goes
> into animation drawing.
>
> Don't ease up on your search. Success is just around the proverbial
> corner.

> May the forces and stretches and angles and all other drawing helps be
> with you.

# *Chapter 1: Go for the Truth*

## Observe, Observe, Observe

> Animation! This is the vehicle you have chosen to express yourself in.
> A whole list of \"tools\" are required: drawing, timing, phrasing,
> action, acting, pantomime, staging, imagination, observation,
> interpretation, logic, caricature, creativity, clarity, empathy, and
> so on---a mind boggling array of prerequisites.
>
> Rest at ease. You were born with all of them. Some of them may need a
> little sharpening, others may need to be awakened as from a deep
> sleep, but they are as much a part of you as arms, legs, eyes,
> kidneys, hemoglobin, and speech.
>
> Reading and observing are two emancipators of the dormant areas of the
> mind. Read the classics, biographies, humor, mysteries and comic
> books. Observe, observe, observe. Be like a sponge---suck up
> everything you can lay your eyes on. Look for the unusual, the common,
> characters, situations, compositions, attitudes study shapes,
> features, personalities, activities, details, etc.
>
> Draw ideas, not things; action, not poses; gestures not anatomical
> structures.
>
> I am reprinting some ruff animation drawings to remind you of the
> style of drawing that seems to serve the purposes of the animators
> best---loose and
>
> expressive.

## Lead to the Emotion

> A well constructed drawing should have all the parts and they should
> be put together beautifully, but that is not what you should see when
> you look at the drawing. What you should see is the emotion. In a
> drawing of a starving man you should see fear and hunger and despair,
> and you should feel this, plus pity and revulsion and anger. All
> gestures won't be quite that dramatic, but all gestures are certainly
> more than their parts.
>
> Do this experiment: get a wooden match and look at it. That represents
> your model or, character in animation. Then light it and let it burn
> half way. Now it represents your model or character in gesture.
>
> ![](vertopal_b37bd7c03c234a8aad2387e1c8154157/media/image10.png){width="5.031427165354331in"
> height="0.6466666666666666in"}
>
> It has been transformed from the anatomical match into a burnt match.
> If you had to draw a burnt match you wouldn\'t say to yourself,
> \"Okay, this is the anatomy of a match.\" No, you would say, \"This is
> a match whose anatomy has been burnt and twisted into an agonizing
> shape. A shape that if I imagine myself being in that state---if I
> feel what has happened to that match has happened also to me---then
> this is the feeling that I have to draw, to portray.\"
>
> We must be emotional about our subject whether it has to do with
> serious matters or with humor. We cannot back off from our emotions --
> if we do the result will he a mere anatomical reproduction. A drawing
> or a scene is not final when a material representation has been made;
> it is final when a sensitive depiction of an emotion has been made.
>
> The significance is not in the story alone, but in the illustration
> that makes that story come alive. Yes, there is anatomy, form,
> construction, model and two or three lines of etceteras, but only in
> so far as those things are expressive of the story.

## Give Them the Experience

> Drawing for animation is not just copying a model onto paper; you
> could do that better with a camera. Drawing for animation is
> translating an action into drawing form so an audience can retranslate
> those drawings back into an experience of that action. You don't just
> want to show the audience an action for them to look at it. You want
> to visualize an action for them to see -- that is, to experience. That
> way you have them in your grasp, your power, and then the story can go
> on and the audience goes on with it, because they are involved. You
> have allowed them to experience it.
>
> The parts of the figure must be put together in a manner that will
> portray or caricature the meaning of the pose. Otherwise it will be
> just a drawing. What a horrible fate -- to be just a drawing.
>
> Here are some animation drawings that have transcended the anatomy and
> model of the characters. They are good drawings, but not just
> drawings.

## The Driving Force behind the Action

> In drawing sessions, I try to direct the students\' thoughts to the
> gesture rather than to the physical presence of the models and their
> sartorial trappings. It seems the less the model wears, the more the
> thinking is directed to anatomy, while the more the model wears, the
> more the thinking goes into drawing the costume. It's a deadlock that
> you can only break by shifting mental gears from the "secondary"
> (details) to the "primary" (motive or driving force behind the pose).
> Remember, the drawing you are doing in class should be thought of as a
> refining process for your animation drawing skills.
>
> I found something in Eric Larson's first lecture on Entertainment,
> which may be of help to you. Please bear with the length of the quote;
> it is put so well I couldn't edit it without losing some of the
> meaning. As you read it, keep your mind on gesture drawing.
>
> ". As we begin the 'ruffing out' of our scene, we become concerned
> with the
>
> believability of the character and the action we've planned and we
> give some
>
> thought to the observation of Constantin Stanislavsky. 'In every
> physical action,' he wrote, 'there is always something psychological
> and vice versa. There is no inner experience without external physical
> expression.' In other words, what is our character thinking to make it
> act, behave and move as it does? As animators, we have to feel within
> ourselves every move and mood we want our drawings to exhibit. They
> are the image of our thoughts.
>
> "In striving for entertainment, our imagination must have neither
> limits nor bounds. It has always been a basic need in creative
> efforts. 'Imagination,' wrote Stanislavsky, 'must be cultivated and
> developed; it must be alert, rich and active. An actor (animator) must
> learn to think on any theme. He must observe people (and animals) and
> their behavior---try to understand their mentality.'
>
> "To one degree or another, people in our audience are aware of human
> and animal behavior. They may have seen, experienced or read about it.
> ... Their knowledge, though limited, acts as a common denominator, and
> as we add to and enlarge upon said traits and behavior and bring them
> to the screen, \'caricatured and alive,\' there blossoms a responsive
> relationship of the audience to the screen character--- and that
> spells "entertainment.\'
>
> "How well we search out every little peculiarity and mannerism of our
> character and how well and with what \'life\' we move and draw it,
> will determine the sincerity of it and its entertainment value, we
> want the audience to view our character on the screen and say: 'I know
> that guy!' (or in the case of gesture drawing: 'I know what that
> person is doing, what he or she is thinking.')
>
> Leonardo da Vinci wrote: 'Build a figure in such a way that its pose
> tells what is in the soul of it. A gesture is a movement not of a body
> but of a soul.' Walt Disney reminded us of this when he spoke of the
> driving force behind the action: 'In other words, in most instances,
> the driving force behind the action is the mood, the personality, the
> attitude of the character---or all three.'
>
> "Let's think of ourselves as pantomimists because animation is really
> a pantomime art. A good pantomimist, having a thorough knowledge of
> human behavior, will, in a very simple action, give a positive and
> entertaining performance. There will be exaggeration in his
> anticipations, attitudes, expressions and movements to make it all
> very visual.
>

## Gesture

> Gesture is the vehicle used in fitting a character into the role it is
> called upon to act out. We have drawn variously, dogs, mice, owls,
> elephants, cats, people, and so on; each distinct characters with
> distinct bodily shapes and bodily gestures. To approach a model with
> the idea of copying a human figure plus its clothing could be called a
> waste of time. Our interest is in seeing the differences in each
> personality and their individualistic gestures and, like a good
> caricaturist, capture the essence of those differences.
>
> When we review the cast of characters in our past films we realize the
> need to place these individual characteristics with the proper
> character and to be consistent in their depiction. Holmes' actions had
> to be different and distinct from Dawson's, or their personalities
> would become a blur. Mickey Mouse had his own personality---his own
> movements and gestures, consistent with his body structure and the
> personality given him. Goofy, a hundredfold different in all ways from
> Mickey, was Goofy because of the same principles used in different
> ways.
>
> There are really only a few principles of drawing but an infinite
> number of personality traits and gestures. To "hole in" after learning
> the body structures is to miss the excitement and the satisfaction of
> using that information to tell the story of life through the nuances
> of gesture.

## The Essence

> The word *essence* to me is almost philosophical in meaning: "That in
> being which underlies all outward manifestations \...\" Applied to
> drawing it is the motive, mood or emotion as displayed through the
> gestures of the physical body.
>
> Anatomy and mechanics are always present too, but in the end the
> essence of each pose must prevail if we want to win the award for best
> animated scene ('scuse me - scenes). Lots of things to think about:
> proportion, anatomy, line, structure, weight, negative space, angles,
> squash and stretch, perspective, and more, but you can be off in lots
> of those areas if you have the essence of the pose.
>
> A little study each day spent on one or another of them will net
> wondrous results. Hopefully, there will soon, suddenly, constantly
> appear in your drawings all of these elements in a satisfying blend.
> You will be pleased and much prospered when they all start to fit
> together and the exhausting battle with each separate one is over.
>
> We are all at different stages of development so must search out our
> own weak areas and concentrate on those. Let's hear it for the spirit
> of search and discovery. Anytime is a time to be adventurous if it
> spurs you on to some worthy goal.
>

## Go For The Truth!

> We actually create nothing of our ourselves---we merely use the
> creative force that activates us. And when we draw we are not using
> the left brain to record facts, we have shifted gears and are now
> using the right brain to create a little one picture story. With, of
> course, the facts that the left brain collected and named and itemized
> in former study periods. This is not a study period; this is a show
> and tell period (time we are not studying).
>
> Do you feel that you are too limited in knowledge? Robert Henri, that
> great teacher of art said that anyone could paint a masterpiece with
> what limited knowledge they have. It would be a matter of using that
> limited knowledge in the right (creative) way. Have you ever seen the
> \"knowledge\" or drawing ability of that great painter Albert Ryder?
> Probably not. But when you look at his nebulous paintings of ships at
> sea or skeletons riding around with nothing on, you sense the drama
> and have a feeling a story in being told. If its facts you want, pick
> up a Sears mail order catalogue.
>
> I\'m not advocating abandoning the study of the figure. Anatomy is a
> vital tool in drawing---but don\'t mesmerize yourself into thinking
> that knowing the figure is going to make an artist of you. What is
> going to make an artist out of you is a combination of a few basic
> facts about the body, a few basic principles of drawing and an

# *Chapter 2: The Animator\'s Sketchbook*

> study. He concentrates upon the model, plumbs its movement, bulk,
> outline. Then he sets it down, remembering that he wants only the

> drawing all his experience. He simplifies. He plays with his line. He
> experiments. He isn\'t concerned with anatomy, chiaroscuro or the
> symmetry of \"flowing line.\" There\'s nothing highbrow about his

## Ron Husband\'s Sketchbook

> Ron Husband appears to be a quiet guy who just goes about his business
> in an even- mannered way. But he is an inveterate sketcher --- his pen
> is constantly searching and probing for incidents of every day life,
> attempting to push them beyond the ordinary --- into the realm of
> entertainment. The 100 filled sketch books in his room (there are a
> 100 more at home) might hoodwink you into thinking that is all he does
> when not animating, but he has several \"irons in the fire,\" and is
> more than capable of doing justice to all of them. He is an
> illustrator for children\'s magazines, and is involved in some very
> imaginative books of his own. Ron doesn\'t confine his drawing to just
> the small sketchbook format, either, I recall an exhibit a year or so
> ago where he displayed many drawings about 17 x 22 inches. They ranged
> from humorous to dramatic, and were most elegantly done.
>
> Ron believes quick sketching is an aid to animation. He maintains
> sketching will enhance drawing ability, quicken your eye, help you to
> analyze action in a shorter period of time. He says the benefits of
> quick sketching are: the ability to capture the essence of a pose, to
> acquire believability in your drawing, to sharpen your awareness of
> \"grid\" or ground planes and backgrounds, a greater familiarity with
> depth, perspective and 3rd dimension, also frees you from thinking in
> terms of the standard 3/4 front or rear view.
>
> Here is a sampling from just a few of his sketchbooks:

## Note Taking and Sketching

> If you haven\'t been a note taker --- become one. Hundreds of
> potentially fertile ideas have drifted through your consciousness and
> have spun out into oblivion to be lost forever.
>
> You often hear or see things that, like a potent horseradish sauce
> clearing the sinuses, sparks a clear vision of some illusive point,
> perhaps some clearer way to draw a wrinkle or some better way to draw
> hands or knees. It seems so clear at the time there seems to be no
> reason to make a note of it.
>
> Many, perhaps dozens of ideas have bombarded your sensitive receptors
> during the day (and night), the overload adjusting itself in favor of
> a few of the most impressive messages, not always the most useful. So
> write them down, or sketch them. They may prove very valuable at a
> later date. A seasoned note taker will often hear a seemingly dull bit
> of information and, either on the spot or later, translate it into a
> meaningful bit of wisdom. Once down in writing or in drawing form it
> can be like a seed planted in fertile soil, burgeoning into growth
> when given the proper inducement.
>
> Taking notes, like sketching, sharpens the mind, hones it into a more
> sensitive and receptive instrument, more ready when needed than one
> that is allowed to \"flow with the tide.\" It can be the difference
> between being a reactor or an actor. The reactor drifts along awaiting
> opportunities from others before making a move. The actor checks his
> notes and comes up with a positive move of his own. Most, if not all,
> artists, composers, authors, scientists, etc. have been and are avid
> note takers and sketchers.
>
> A three ring, loose leaf note book with unlined paper is ideal for
> writing, sketching, and storing notes in. It may be too large to carry
> with you everywhere, so augment it with a small notepad that will fit
> into a pocket or purse. The notes taken in the small pad can be
> removed and taped or glued into the larger book. Record the source, or
> initial those of your own origin --- also the date. It will be a great
> focus of learning, a pleasurable hobby, and will help keep your mind
> alert for new ideas and to new vistas of creative thinking.
>
> Your note/sketch book can and should contain both writing and
> sketching. Memories are often useful in creative work. Present day
> experiences are worthy of recording, saved and savored. Jot down only
> the pertinent details.
>
> Sketch scenes, expressions --- make comments beneath the sketches.
> Describe people you know and meet. Don\'t correct your impressions
> later --- better to write or draw new ones. Develop your senses by
> becoming aware of them. Record them in a straightforward manner and/or
> caricature them to some humorous extreme. What you will be doing is
> sharpening your sensibilities, increasing your susceptibility to
> impressions, refining your ability to perceive and to transpose them
> into graphic form. Soon you will find yourself exploring your world
> for impressions and the recording of them will buoy you up mentally,
> physically, and spiritually.
>
> Remember my formula for this: impression -- expressions depression. So
> become a note taker, start collecting things --- not through one ear
> or eye and out the other, but graphically, through your fingers, which
> are the things you have chosen to express
>
> yourself through. Copy words, phrases, bits of articles, drawings,
> paintings, anything that awakens a spark in you.

## Good Habits

# *Chapter 3: A Visual Vocabulary for Drawing*

> In a sense, drawing is learned by accumulating a visual vocabulary,

> were no words, and at that point man had limited ways to communicate
> his thoughts---simple as they probably were. Our present way of

## A Simple Approach to Drawing

> For those in my class who have had little instruction or experience, I
> would suggest adopting a very simple approach to drawing. Even those
> who are experienced but have neglected working from a model can
> benefit from this.
>
> The most logical approach when faced with a model is to lay in the
> basic pose with some simple elemental shapes. Ignore the details of
> the costume. First study the pose for the gesture---you may have to
> add a little of your own thespianism---then look for weight
> distribution and over all abstract shape (silhouette), ignoring all
> particulars like muscles or other detail, and go for the general,
> overall generic gesture. This gives you the opportunity also to
> concentrate on relative proportions. Proportions are important and you
> must develop sensitivity to them---Mickey, Roger Rabbit, the Mermaid,
> Eric, Sebastian---all with distinct proportions.
>
> Here are some suggestions for a simple approach. You'll not be
> encumbered or confused by a multitude of superfluous lines and
> puzzling shapes. Once you have the pose captured, the costume will be
> easier to put on. And using the known facts about wrinkles, you will
> be able to pick and choose the appropriate wrinkles from the model or
> make up some of your own. Let me suggest that in working out your
> "shorthand" body-shape, when the chest and hip are twisted, they can
> be handled as separate shapes. That way you can more easily draw them
> facing in different directions. When they are not twisting, the chest
> and hip areas can be treated as one shape.
>

## Finding the Abstract

> I keep searching for a shortcut to learning how to draw, but as Ollie
> Johnston used to say of drawing in general, "It ain't easy."
>
> Try to look for the overall abstract shape. I use the word abstract
> here in the sense of a summary---a brief statement of the essential
> elements. I sketched these abstracted shapes of some familiar (male)
> body types. If when drawing from life you can spot one of these shapes
> (or one of your own design) in the character you are drawing, it will
> save you the agony of searching for lines on the model to copy. If you
> know the overall abstract shape you are dealing with, it will be
> easier to apply that to the gesture.
>
> ![](vertopal_b37bd7c03c234a8aad2387e1c8154157/media/image46.png){width="6.0in"
> height="2.2916666666666665in"}
>
> Finding the abstract in the gesture itself will help too. Take a
> moment to study the type of body build, forming an abstract shape of
> it in your mind, then do the same with the overall pose. It simply
> means dropping 90% of the detail, and seeing only that 10% --- that
> essence of the pose.
>
> This kind of thinking will lead to more expressive drawing, especially
> in animation where body language is so important. It will aid you in
> capturing the essence of a gesture, and with an economy of lines. My
> philosophy is: if you can draw it with 10 lines, why use 75? And who
> can argue with the philosophy: if you can draw it in 5 minutes, why
> take a half hour?
>
> A loose style allows you to study and practice drawing
> action---something that is hard to do if you try to make a cleaned-up,
> finished drawing as you go.

## The Solid-Flexible Model

> Humans, most animals and to a degree cartoon characters are
> constructed on a solid- flexible basis:

> height="4.1066666666666665in"}
>
> A cartoon character is more flexible, but the principle of
> solid-flexible is applicable because the same parts are there---they
> are merely caricatured.
>
> The solid-flexible concept is the basis for all the angles that
> portray the various actions, moods, and expressions that we are called
> upon to draw. Each section has a limited yet unique movement to
> perform. Those movements are the means through which we express all of
> our body communications. Try to relate some incident in you life, or
> mimic someone else\'s with your neck in a brace and your hands tied
> behind your back. You would make up for it by bending at the waist and
> the knees. You would make the whole upper part of you body do what
> your head normally does, and the bending of your knees take the place
> of hand gestures.
>
> We\'ll see more of the solid-flexible model later in animating squash
> and stretch.

## The Pipe Model

> There is another approach to drawing the figure that may seem a bit
> bizarre at first, but is worth your consideration. It is especially
> helpful when working out a difficult foreshortening problem. The
> method merely employs pipes, or cylinders, as parts of the body.
>
> When cylinders are used to establish the basic shapes, their angles,
> directions and relationships, then it is an easy matter to add the
> details. Again, the details only after the basics are well
> established. Don\'t be impatient---the foundation first. To avoid
> \'doodling\' while practicing this form of study, confine yourself to
> these shapes:

## Seeing in Three Dimensions

> The ability to see in three dimensions is fairly near the top of the
> list of requirements for the animator, assistant animator, and the
> in-betweener. Most of us come by this knowledge only after years of
> observation and practice. The more I\'ve thought about it, the more
> I\'ve come to believe the rules of perspective ought to be called the
> \"all encompassing principles of drawing.\" I never make a drawing
> without being conscious of them, and when I am having trouble with a
> drawing, I delve into those rules and they are a sure help.
>
> As artists we see through eyes that constantly search for shape,
> gesture, color, contrast, and so on. When we draw from the model (or
> from life in general) we have a tendency to feature shape. A thing is
> either round or oblong or rectangular or some combination of each.
> These in turn create the two-dimensional negative space that forms a
> relationship between one or more objects or parts of one object. It
> requires an extra nudge of observation to see things as
> three-dimensional, and two extra nudges to translate that third

## Direction

> Bruce McIntyre\'s system also involved directional symbols, consisting
> of simple arrows pointing in a number of directions. Each arrow and
> its direction had a code number. Their use was related to the manner
> in which Bruce taught drawing. I had never involved myself with his
> use of them, but the principle of it completely captivated me. It has
> influenced every drawing and painting I've made since being exposed to
> it. It has made me conscious of the fact that everything is pointing
> in some direction; pointing away from us or sideways to us or three
> quarters up at a certain angle; straight at us or slightly to the left
> or right or down. Most often these directional lines coincide with
> perspective lines and have a common vanishing point.
>
> In the case of drawing a figure, the line directions are not random
> but have to do with the pose or action. To be conscious of the

## A Simple Approach to Costumes and Drapery

> The draped figure will be one of the many problems that will follow
> you like a heel fly throughout your career. Wrinkles, folds, seams,
> belts, pleats, ruffles and shirring \[puckering or gathering of
> material with stitches\] all seem so important and at times, downright
> overwhelming. Their importance cannot be denied, but their reason for
> being there and looking the way they do must be carefully considered.
>
> Let's face it---clothes cannot act. If clothes seem to act it is
> because the body underneath is acting (posing or gesturing). The
> clothes will react in a like manner and will even
>
> enhance the gesture. But if the drawing has not captured the gesture,
> all the manipulation of wrinkles, lumps, bulges, folds, and seams will
> not bring off the drawing. A real solid, expressive, sparkly drawing
> is one where the clothing is doing what the body is causing it to do.
>
> The best thing for you to do (to keep your sanity) is strive to handle
> it in the simplest way possible. In animation, costumes may run from
> simple to complex in style, but they are all handled in a simple
> manner when it comes to folds and wrinkles.
>
> It helps to mentally take the clothing apart to see how it is
> constructed. For instance a sleeve: how big around is the shoulder
> opening; how is it attached to the bodice; does it taper; does the
> shoulder seam attach at or below the shoulder? Ward Kimball's great
> observation is very apropos here. He said if he could take something
> apart and put it back together again, he could draw it.
>
> For the sake of studying the figure for animation, lines of clothing
> should not be sketched in just for an impression---they should be
> logical. If you were to use that drawing in a scene, those drapery
> lines would have to animate as a secondary action---the primary action
> being the body itself.
>
> Reasons! Reasons! Reasons! Always look for logical reasons for the
> shapes of the clothing or drapery---and the reason will always be
> found in the bodily gestures.
>
> There is a kind of shorthand for drapery that is standardized for all
> characters. Most Disney characters only have wrinkles at the joints,
> and then only when there is pressure applied by bending or squeezing.
> So they'll occur at elbows and knees, and at the waist when seated.
> Women's clothes have wrinkles caused by pleats, gathers, puffed
> sleeves, etc., but you can always count them on two or three fingers.
> An excess of material will cause meaningless folds, bumps, and bulges.

> This is not to suggest simplicity is easy---just less frustrating.

> A clear understanding of drapery plus a general understanding of the
> types of garment construction would be helpful. There is a book
> called, *The Complete Book of Fashion*
>
> *Illustration*, by Sharon Lee Tate and Mona Shafer Edwards (Harper &

> that seems to have no potential for energy; it just lies there,
> inactive.
>
> Being aware of these somewhat simple categories of folds will help you
> to interpret what happens to drapery under certain conditions. Also,
> the more complex actions and poses will cause those categories to
> overlap and produce a hybrid fold, which, without the benefit of
> knowing the origin of the contributing folds, might prove to be
> slightly bewildering.
>
> So when you see a fold that is hard to categorize, with the help of

> in simple terms.

> more simplified forms of drapery---those that match the action or
> enhance the pose. With the help of Vilppu's list of folds, it will be
> easier to spot and identify such problem areas as you are forming your
> first impression.
>
> It might also help to develop a vocabulary of drapery action terms
> such as: *hang, suspend, dangle, swing freely, be pendent, adhere to,

# *Chapter 4: The First Impression*

> Try this experiment: look at your surroundings---a panorama of scenery
> is ideal for this--- and direct your mind to slip in and out of some
> selected modes. First concentrate on color. You should be able to
> eliminate all the other elements and see just areas of color.
>
> Then switch to dark and light, then to masses, then to the
> three-dimensional qualities of things near and far. Now, try to see
> all of those things at once. Your mind may have to do a little jig,
> skipping back and forth between them, for it\'s rather hard to
> concentrate on more than one thing at a time. But if you keep at it,
> it will all come together and the totality of the scene will hit you
> like a bomb.
>
> That is the *first impression* I speak about. It is sometimes referred
> to as a moment of inspiration; a moment of utter clarity; that instant
> of pure seeing that Betty Edwards (Drawing On The Artist Within) calls
> the "Ah - Ha!" moment. Actually it's just an extremely vivid summation
> of all the important elements before you. It hits you so hard and
> clear it is relatively easy to recall when you need a fresh look at
> it.
>
> Getting a strong first impression is the first, necessary step to
> analyzing the components of the pose.

## Short-pose Sketching

> When practicing gesture drawing with a live model, the poses should be
> relatively short, so that a quick first impression can be summoned,
> worked on and developed---you won't have time to get involved in
> detail or "cleanup."
>
> Short pose sketching also excites you to a higher pitch of awareness
> so the creative juices flow more freely, and seeing becomes more
> acute. Quick sketching promulgates a feeling of spontaneity in the
> drawings. Most importantly, the short pose condenses the whole process
> of drawing so the wholeness of the gesture predominates and the
> gestural qualities of the pose permeate the entire process of drawing.
>
> In the time it takes some artists to do one drawing (and that one
> often nowhere near completed) others have sketched in three or four
> tries. This encourages experimentation and looking for alternate
> interpretations of the gesture. Trying for variations of the pose will
> sharpen your observation and your hand/eye coordination, and help you
> to seek out subtle nuances of the gesture. After all, if you had to
> draw several of the Disney characters in the same pose, you'd have to
> vary each one according to the personality of that character.
>
> In class, I try to get the artists to stop copying the model,
> especially in a ponderous fashion wherein the gesture is difficult to
> feel, and so often takes a back seat to the details. I encourage
> flexibility. Sketching quickly and loosely will help you to be more
> creative, inventive, inspired and will train you to be more adaptable
> and versatile (more fun, too).

## Superficial Appearance vs. Creative Portrayal

> In the course of animating on a picture, you will be called upon to
> draw many different actions, each one calling for a distinct set of
> gestures. Your character might have to display a variety of
> expressions like happiness, anger, confusion, determination, etc.,
> with actions that match each of those emotions. The character will no
> doubt have to walk, turn, stoop, stretch, extend arms, etc. There will
> be a number of characters in the film and each one of them will have
> different personalities that will require appropriate gestures, none
> of which will be repeated---at least not in exactly the same way.
>
> In a classroom situation where you are studying a live model, it is
> nearly impossible to anticipate those action requirements, so you have
> to concentrate on the ability to capture those gestures the model
> performs for you. This, in effect, hones your sensitivity for seeing
> bodily actions, so that you are better able to apply your skills to
> future needs. It is nearly impossible also to find models who are
> \"look-alikes\" to match the characters in the various stories. This
> may be a blessing, in that if you could find them you would surely be
> tempted to copy the superficial appearance of the model, rather than
> using the time and opportunity to further your skills in gesture
> drawing. After all, gesture drawing to the animator is what acting is
> to the stage or movie actor. What the actor portrays on the stage or
> before the camera is what the animator draws on paper.
>
> When working from a model you must keep in mind the fact that you are
> not copying what is before you, but that you are searching for a
> gesture---one that will be applicable to any character that you might
> be called upon draw (animate), say, the mermaid, one of the sailors,
> or the prince in the "Mermaid," Mickey or Goofy. Again I use the term
> "shift gears" (mental gears), to picture the release from the shackles
> of any false burden, responsibility or obligation to copy the model.
>
> A scene of animation is more or less a series of gesture drawings. The
> difference being that an animator\'s drawing is likely to have some
> things in it that are not associated with still drawings. For
> instance, an animation drawing might have some overlapping action,
> some drag, some squash and stretch, a stance that may be off balance,
> or a view that one would avoid or adjust in a still drawing. But
> basically the extremes in a scene of animation are gestural drawings
> created to fit the needs of the story.
>
> A perceptive and keen observation in regard to gesture (acting) is
> essential to the animator.
>
> \"Completion (of a drawing) does not depend on material
> representation. The work is done when that special thing has been
> said.\"---Robert Henri
>
> The purpose of working with a live model is to sharpen your awareness
> of the possibilities of the human figure to tell a \"story\" with body
> language. Assuming you understand basic anatomy, you know where the
> knees are, how they work and their general functions; likewise all
> other parts of the body. At this point, to merely copy what is before
> you would be just to solidify your position on a plateau, short of
> your potential.
>
> Now is the time to transcend that ability to make a carbon copy
> likeness of the model, and to discover, reveal and disclose the rich
> assortments and subtleties of body language Then you will be better
> equipped to formulate the future needed variations and apply them to
> whatever character you happen to be working on.

> All the above is to try to convince you to stop tiring your eyes by
> glancing back and forth from model to paper in an attempt to make a
> pretty copy but rather to \"shift mental gears,\" looking past the
> flesh to the spirit of the pose---and to draw that. Think caricature,
> think essence of gesture, think going beyond to a better than average

## A New Phrase: "Body Syntax"

> There is an insistent tendency to look at the model in a serious, even
> detached way---as if it were a still life devoid of feeling and
> personality. We look at the model to pick a starting point, we draw
> it. We look back to see if we did it right, make a few more dabs at it
> to reassure ourselves, we look up for another line to add---perhaps
> connected to the first one, perhaps somewhere else in some unrelated
> area. We look down; sketch in the new line tentatively. Reinforce it,
> after another look at the model, with several swipes of the pen. The
> gesture goes unrecognized. The more unrelated lines that get put down,
> the farther from our grasp goes the gesture.
>
> Imagine yourself drawing a simple shape like a circle or a square. Do
> you see yourself sketching a bit here or there, going over what you
> awe done, then on to another section, seeing only those small sections
> of line you are putting down? No, of course not! You see a circle and
> the size you want to make it and in as few lines as possible---wham!
> Down it goes.
>
> A human body is more complicated, granted, but the act of drawing its
> gesture is much the same. You must see the whole, and wham (over a
> longer period of time, of course), down it goes. You have hardly
> looked at the details. They influence and enhance the pose (gesture)
> but are somewhat incidental to it. If it is gesture you are interested
> in, then look beyond those extraneous, sometimes gesture-destroying
> details.
>
> I love to read. I love the way authors put their words together. I
> love syntax. I love the way the words reveal the plot and the
> personalities of the protagonists that carry me along
>
> in the plot. But if I\'m not careful, I get caught up in admiring the
> details and how the story is being told, getting behind in what the
> story is about.
>
> We have been having some terrific models whose \"details\" (body
> syntax) are fascinating to the point of distraction. It seems like the
> more interesting the details, the more difficult it is to see the
> simplicity of the gesture. So, as it takes a special effort on my part
> to read for the story, so it is with most of us---we have to make a
> special effort to draw for the gesture.
>
> Earlier I mentioned body syntax. That\'s a phrase worth coining. The
> non-grammatical meaning of syntax is: \"Connected system or order;
> orderly arrangement.\" What is a pose or gesture but an orderly
> arrangement of body parts to display a mood, demeanor, attitude,
> mannerism, expression, emotion---whatever. That phrase \"orderly
> arrangement\" (body syntax), is worth ruminating over. An orderly
> arrangement of body parts. I love it. Even the sentence places
> arrangement before parts.
>
> Once the physical faculties of manipulating a pen or pencil to one\'s
> satisfaction is conquered, that side of drawing is taken care of and
> from there on it is mental. It\'s then the ability to analyze,
> imagine; to caricature, to assemble and organize all the separate
> elements of storytelling into one drawing or into a series of drawings
> (animation). As we have come to realize since Dr. Betty Edwards,
> drawing is a right brain activity. The left brain is a serious namer
> of things, while the right brain uses all that seriousness for some
> creative purpose. The left and right sides of the brain are the \"odd
> couple\" of the cerebral community---the right side being the slightly
> less serious.

## The \"Explosive\" Gesture

> A couple of weeks ago we had the wonderful Bobby Ruth as our model. I

> clown for us. (The night before that she did a sexy night club
> performer.) The wonderful play-acting she did unearthed a typical
> clown-like character that was as distinctive as one of Red Skelton's
> characters, or Bob Newhart, or any other performer whose
> characteristic style is as memorable. If you saw Bobby in a
> supermarket checkout line, she might blend into the crowd, but while
> performing, she has that unique ability to carry us beyond the
> ordinary. She seems to transform herself into another realm---one of
> pure gesture.
>
> But it's not just the job of the model to do this---it's our goal too.
> We want to go beyond just making a drawing of arms and legs and
> clothes. We want to draw something that tells a story like our models
> do.
>
> Drawing is really your reaction to life---to the bits of life you are
> sketching. It is not merely a collection of parts being put down on
> paper. It's more like the colorful display of fireworks after they
> have exploded in the sky, revealing their final "gesture." You can't
> see that gesture by just handling the physical thing called a Sky
> Fountain, or whatever they are called; it has to explode to reveal its
> beauty. So with a drawing.
>
> Handling the human parts of the body will reveal nothing but the means
> to the end---the end being when it assumes one of its story-packed
> gestures.
>
> As you draw, you feel as much as see the gesture as it comes to life
> on your paper. There is a kind of flush that grips you. If you are
> just seeing the parts, they will always remain parts, but if you go
> for the final "explosive" gesture, the parts will fall into place and
> the pose magnificent will emerge.
>
> Here's a paragraph from *Drawing on the Artist Within*, by Betty
> Edwards, which is quite apropos:
>
> "Gesture drawing is a technique of very rapid drawing, one drawing
> after another, perhaps fifteen scribbled drawings accomplished in
> fifteen minutes or less. It works, I believe to "set aside" the
> strong, verbal left-hemisphere mode, perhaps in the following way.
> L-mode, which prefers a rather slow (relatively speaking)
>
> step-by-step linear, sequential, analytic procedure for drawing,
> preferably using familiar namable forms, says, in effect, "First we'll
> draw the head, (let's see, that's sort of an oval); then the neck (two
> lines); then the shoulders (two slanty lines from the neck)\..." But
> in gesture drawing, L-mode finds you drawing helter- skelter, all over
> the page, saying to yourself, "Just get it down! Faster! Faster!
>
> And L-mode objects, "If you're going to draw that stupid way, count me
> out! I like to do things the sensible way---my way! One thing at a
> time, the way... we... always\... do\..." And L-mode bows out.

## Feel, As Well As See, the Gesture

> I repeatedly harp on feeling the pose rather than merely looking at
> it. By looking at it only, you have to keep looking at it repeatedly
> as you copy the parts. In feeling the pose, I mean actually picturing
> in your mind yourself doing the pose. If you have to, stand up, put
> down your drawing board and assume the pose. Feel which muscles pull
> or contract to get which stretch or squash. Feel where the weight
> falls, what is entailed to keep your balance. Feel the psychological
> attitude it imparts. For example, if the head is drooped, does it
> evoke a sad or disappointed feeling? If the head is held high, do you
> feel proud or haughty or reverent---or what?
>
> So with the whole body, impose some kind of attitude on it. Then you
> have that pose locked into your mind and can summon it up at will by
> simply seeing it in your mind and assuming that attitude. As a matter
> of fact you can see it from any vantage point---you could even do some
> mental levitation and look down on it from above.
>
> Contrast that approach with the slow and ponderous neck-tiring process
> of looking at the model, noticing the angle of the upper arm, looking
> back to the paper and. sketching in the upper arm, then looking at the
> model to see what the lower arm is doing, then back to the paper to
> sketch that in, then back to the model to search out the next thing to
> draw,
>
> then back to the paper to see if what you have already drawn will give
> you a clue to what to add next, and so on.
>
> The "feeling the pose" method is of great help in a live sketching
> where you have an awkward view of the model; say a view where one leg
> and one arm are hidden from your view. With the live model the pose is
> somewhat clear because there are dozens of telltale indications of
> what is going on, but these illusive indications are difficult to
> capture in a line drawing. However, if you lock into the pose, you can
> make the necessary adjustments required to clarify the pose. After
> all, in animation you would have to do that. You go to great lengths
> to get everything "out in the open" to make your pose "readable" ---so
> why not in a practice session. I'm sure you all know how to fantasize.
>
> Okay, put it to use in drawing.
>
> If you can lock into the pose, you can also fantasize the pose into
> useful variations--- which sounds a little like animating.
>
> I came across a book \"How to Draw the Human Figure\" from the Famous
> Artists School. Lo and behold, they also stress the importance of
> seeing in order to learn to draw well, and to first feel the gesture
> before attempting to draw it. They also strongly advise assuming a new
> mood with each change of pose, bringing a freshness and spontaneity to
> each and every sketch.
>
> To carry the idea further, it would help to quickly assume the pose
> yourself, to feel it, to experience it, in order to jettison yourself
> into the proper frame of mind. Further into the book I find other
> points that were brought up in our classes such as: gesture drawing is
> more than just copying the action of the figure. It has, especially
> for us, to do with capturing the inner meaning, the essence of the
> pose---what is happening at that moment. With and through that first
> impression sketch, a good final drawing is assured.

## Draw Verbs, Not Nouns

> A sure way to keep from making static, lifeless drawings is to think
> of drawing "verbs" instead of "nouns." Basically, a noun names a
> person place, or thing; a verb asserts, or expresses action, a state
> of being, or an occurrence.
>
> I speak often of shifting mental gears, and here is another place to
> do it. The tendency to copy what is before us without taking time (or
> effort) to ferret out what is happening action-wise, is almost
> overwhelming.
>
> Let's say for example, the model (and this also goes for making a
> drawing without a model) is leaning over with her elbows extended. If
> you approach the pose from the standpoint of drawing nouns, you will
> name and draw the parts (humerus, radius, ulna, scapula, biceps,
> triceps, deltoid, etc.) and place them as best you can in the
> positions suggested by the model. With good hand/eye coordination, or
> a good memory, or either a model or a good anatomy book handy, you can
> produce a fairly handsome drawing of nouns. If you approach the pose
> from the standpoint of drawing verbs, you will simply be using those
> nouns to produce a drawing that portrays a woman bending over,
> stretching
>
> ![](vertopal_b37bd7c03c234a8aad2387e1c8154157/media/image162.png){width="2.4738188976377953in"
> height="4.124998906386701in"}her arms, pulling her hair, about to push
> the towel over her hair to dry it. You feel the hair below her left
> hand hanging; you feel the right arm cocked and ready to push forward.
> You feel the back stretching and the left side squashing, you feel the
> downward motion set up by the angles of her forearms.
>
> The body is also balancing, twisting and angling. You feel she is
> thinking about what she is doing--- not just frozen into a still life.
>
> Now there is a list of verbs that should develop into a drawing that
> has the breath of life in it. The pose could be described by nouns:
> "woman after bath," but verbs would charge it with the life giving
> qualities of bodily movement, rhythm, motion and action allowing the
> viewer to participate vicariously.

## Draw with a Purpose

> To doodle, according to the dictionary, means to scribble aimlessly. A
> drawing on the other hand has an aim; it has a reason for being. It
> may be an illustration, a depiction, a caricature, a recording of some
> incident, a person, or a decoration. When making a drawing for
> animation or for animation study it must be saying something, that is,
> depicting an action or a mood, otherwise it becomes a mere doodle.
>
> If you wanted to play Mozart music on the piano, you wouldn't doodle
> on the piano hoping someday to come across something that sounded like
> Mozart. No, first you would study the rules---the rudiments of music
> and then with a little practice you could bring Mozart to life.
> Drawing is no different.
>
> An animator cannot relax into the luxury of doodling, for his drawings
> have to "say" something, must communicate something.
>
> So. whenever studying drawing to better yourself for animation, don't
> doodle (draw
>
> aimlessly). Draw with a purpose---go for the gesture. Save your
> doodling for telephone calls.

## Dividing the Body into Units

> All too often in sketching, if you don\'t see the whole figure (the
> figure as a whole, that is) it is possible to end up with a delightful
> drawing, but which is at variance with the pose or gesture. This is
> fine when doodling---to start out with a nothing in mind---somewhere
> on the paper---and end up with a presentable drawing with a gesture of
> its own (but not
>
> yours). But when striving for a predetermined gesture, a measure of
> discipline is necessary.
>
> Imagine yourself a pilot landing a plane. Some weird phenomenon has
> blotted out all but a tiny detail of the field. Right---MAYDAY!
> MAYDAY! You need the whole field so you can make a good judgment of
> the situation. Okay, the same with drawing. You need the whole body
> (the field) to keep your judgment of the gesture true.
>
> ![](vertopal_b37bd7c03c234a8aad2387e1c8154157/media/image163.png){width="2.7706517935258095in"
> height="3.46in"}Any of you who play a musical instrument will know
> that you have to use your peripheral vision to look ahead a measure or
> two to keep any kind of continuity going. The music must be reproduced
> perfectly or something is lost (most likely the audience). The rhythm
> would falter unmusically if the notes were read one at a time.
> Likewise in drawing, the pose must be captured with a continuity of
> form---a looking ahead to tie all the parts into a rhythmical and
> faithful expression of the pose.
>
> One way to keep continuity of parts in your sketches is to divide the
> body into two or three units. While sketching in unit \#1 see unit \#2
> clearly in your peripheral vision and even, in a lesser degree the 3rd
> unit. Then while sketching unit \#2 keep the 3rd unit clearly in mind
> plus the unit you have just sketched in. The idea being that the whole
> pose must be kept constantly in mind---no going off and drawing a head
> or an arm as something separate, but rather as parts of a whole. The
> relationship of the shoulders, elbows, hands, etc., and especially the
> foot on which the whole body is on, must be \"mapped out\" or planned
> ahead so the essence of the pose is not lost---or in regard to the
> weight, the whole drawing be off balance.
>
> Let the mind and the eye constantly scan the pose so as not to lose
> sight of the first impression---which was the fresh, vivid view of the
> whole gesture before you got involved in drawing the parts.

## \"Knowing\" or Searching

> There are two methods of drawing, especially with regard to capturing
> the gesture. Both are invaluable. But it is important to know the
> difference and be able to use either of them at will.
>
> In the gesture sketching class, I have students use pen and ink
> exclusively. The reason for this is to try to transfer the function of
> drawing away from the hand and to the mind---to eliminate a tendency
> to render, and to train the eye to see the gesture at a glance rather
> than feel it out on the paper with a multitude of searching and
> superfluous lines. I contend
>
> that in a model drawing situation, the pose is already there;
> searching is not necessary. The use of a pen forces one to distill the
> essence of the pose in the mind's eye and in turn draw it the way one
> sees it.
>
> Of course, when there is no model and when a needed gesture is not
> clear in the mind, by all means start searching. I am not putting down
> using a multitude of lines---one may come to rely on it for it
> sometimes accidentally locates things in its meandering lines, from
> which all one has to do is pick out the best ones. Ultimately, the
> searching method may be the style you will use in animation, for there
> will be no model before you to lean on.
>
> But this method borders on doodling, which can become a habit. Even
> when you don\'t have a model to hold the pose, you can use your
> kinetic sense of motion---the feeling of the pose in our own bodies,
> or "living" the pose, or being at one with the gesture and "knowing"
> it, without having to discover the gesture in a model. The ability to
> distill the essence of the pose, acquired through the practice of
> using a pen, will let you draw the pose the way you feel it in your
> body. This will in every sense be a shortcut to capturing the gesture
> on paper.

## Simplicity for the Sake of Clarity

> One of our models, Ian Steele, said a very significant thing to me
> after a session. He said after holding a pose for some minutes he no
> longer had that fresh, intense feeling for the pose that he had when
> he first assumed it. That is something that happens in all phases of
> life. The artist, when he first gets an inspiration or tackles a pose
> in an action analysis class, sees the pose, is struck by its clarity,
> its expressiveness, then after working on it for a while that first
> impression is gone and with it goes any chance of capturing it on
> paper. That\'s the reason we should learn to get that first impression
> down right away---while it\'s fresh, while it\'s still in that first
> impression stage before it starts to fade.
>
> It\'s not an easy thing to do. You have studied anatomy and have spent
> many hours admiring your favorite artists until a foregone conclusion
> as to how to draw something sets in. Now you are bombarded with new
> gestures and new concepts. You are called upon to see the essence of
> the gesture and get it down before it slides back into a watered- down
> pose or before your foregone conclusions alter your new found vision.
>
> Detail doesn\'t buy you anything at this stage of the drawing.
> Doodling with detail will cause you to lose that first impression. The
> time to study bone structure and muscles is in anatomy class or at
> home with a good book on anatomy. In an action analysis class a rough
> circle is all you need to locate and suggest a knee or an elbow or a
> wrist. Two lines is all you need to locate and suggest the various
> parts of the arms and legs---preferably one of them straight and the
> other curved; the straight one being used on the stretch side and the
> curved one being used on the squash side. When I say locate and
> suggest, that is exactly what and all you need. What you are drawing
> is a pose, not parts. The simplest kind of suggestion is the surest
> way to a good drawing.
>
> Any of you who have studied Zen will be familiar with the practice of
> seeing everything anew constantly. You don\'t dig up the past and use
> it to make judgments on the present. Everything is new, there is only
> now, this moment, so each moment has that first impression newness.
> Applied to drawing, each moment reveals the pose as if you had just
> seen it for the first time. Every stroke you make with the pencil is
> like a knife edge that carves out the pose as if it were the first
> time you ever saw it.
>
> I have Xeroxed a little series of drawings from *The Illusion of Life*

# *Chapter 5: Elements of the Pose*

*Those who cannot begin do not finish.*

--- Robert Henri: The Art Spirit

> In our model sketching sessions we naturally employ our efforts to
> drawing the model, but our attention is directed not so much to
> copying or getting a photographic likeness but rather to studying and
> capturing the essence of the poses. Our goal is to be able to apply
> the principles we learn to our animation drawings---whether we are
> animating, cleaning up or inbetweening.
>
> In searching the model's pose for a good first impression that says,
> "This is what the model is doing, or thinking," look not for the
> elements that make up the *figure* (anatomical parts), but rather look
> for the elements that make up the *pose*.
>
> Our real goal in studying a model is to draw not bones muscles and
> insignificant details, but rather squash and stretch and weight
> distribution, plus---just to keep life interesting--- composition,
> shape and form, perspective, line and silhouette, tension, planes,
> negative and positive shapes, to mention a few.
>
> These elements will vary with the gesture, but usually will feature
> something like:

1.  **Weight distribution.** How the figure balances itself because of
    > what it is doing.

2.  **Thrust.** Body language usually requires a hip to be thrust out, a
    > shoulder up, knees apart, or an arm out (as in throwing something
    > or pointing), etc.

3.  **Angles.** Straight up and down figures are generally stiff and
    > static. Angles will add life and a feeling of movement.

4.  **Tension.** Whenever one member of the body moves there is the set
    > up between it and its counterpart. You can capture an effective
    > tension by working one elbow against the other elbow; one knee
    > against the other. Likewise the feet, hands, and the shoulders.
    > Never draw one appendage without planning a counter move with its
    > opposite. never.

5.  **Straight against curve.** All work and no play makes a long and
    > dreary day---or something like that. All curves and no straights
    > make a dreary drawing. Straights and curves used indiscriminately
    > are but trickery, but when used logically they can emphasize and
    > clarify the gesture. Straights and curves also tie in perfectly
    > with one of animation's key tools, *squash and stretch*.

6.  **Extremes of the pose.** Extremes in animation usually mean the
    > farthermost extension of some pose or the drawing just prior to a
    > change of direction. A single drawing also has extremes, which, in
    > a flash, explains what is happening in the pose. Those extremes
    > are vital to such an explanation. To the degree they are missing
    > or diluted, the drawing will deteriorate from "expressive" to
    > "bland" to "confusing" to downright "boring." Silhouette almost
    > explains "extreme," but not if it is thought of as a tracing of
    > the outside of the figure. Forces are at play in a gesture, and it
    > is force and thrust and tension that generate an extreme.

> A perceptive overall distribution of all these elements concentrates
> the viewer\'s attention on the vital aspects of the gesture. To gloss
> over them in a muddled and nebulous way is to cheat the viewer out of
> a clear look at what you are trying to "say".
>
> Here is another quote from "The Art Spirit" (I replaced the words
> *portrait* and *painting*
>
> with the word *drawing*.)
>
> "An interest in the subject; something you want to say definitely
> about the subject; this is the first condition of a drawing. The
> processes of drawing spring from this interest, this definite thing to
> be said. Completion does not depend on material representation. The
> work is done when that special thing has been said. The artist starts
> with an opinion (first impression), he organizes the materials (the
> elements I spoke of above), from which and with which he draws, to the
> expression of the opinion (first impression). The things have no
> longer their dead meaning but have become living parts of a
> coordination. To start with a deep impression, the best, the most
> interesting, the deepest you can have of the model; to preserve this
> vision throughout the work; to see nothing else; to admit of no
> digression from it. every element in the picture will be constructive,
>
> constructive of an idea, expressive of an emotion. Every factor in the
> drawing will have beauty because in its place in the organization, it
> is doing its living part. It is only through a sense of the right
> relation of things that freedom can be obtained."
>
> An actor may have a pleasant voice, perfect diction, proper emphasis,
> all the qualities necessary to make a good performer, but if his
> accompanying body language is unclear, the audience is left in a "no
> man's land", and up goes the "TILT" sign. The audience is left with
> some undecipherable bits of information. Likewise the artist. There
> may be an appealing technique, but if the message is garbled, the
> purpose of the drawing is lost.
>
> The accompanying drawings all contain corrections that illustrate the
> all-important elements of the pose. The correction (suggestions) were
> not done to teach anyone "how to draw," but rather how to see those
> elements and to make them the basis for all drawings. They are easy to
> spot if you look for them when making your first impression. If you
> start your drawing without locating them, you may find yourself
> drawing without a purpose, or your purpose may evolve into a desperate
> search to find out what went wrong with your drawing.

## Angles and Tension

> Angles and tension are important elements in drawing. Little has been
> said about them in books on drawing and in drawing classes. They can
> be the difference between a do- nothing drawing and an active, dynamic
> drawing. Tension is brought about by the appropriate use of angles in
> a drawing.
>
> It is easy to imagine how a running figure can create tension by the
> angle of his body. Any time you pull a figure off its perpendicular
> norm you create tension. The figure is pulling away from one border
> and pushing toward the other. There is also a tension set up between
> the figure and the ground surface---for it would fall if something
> weren\'t done to stabilize it. There are tensions set up within the
> body, also, such as between the outstretched arm and the opposite
> outstretched leg. That tension is eased as the body prepares to change
> from one leg to the other. Then the tension is set up again on the
> opposite side.
>
> Of utmost importance is any deviation from the perpendicular axis. We
> humans are very sensitive to it. We can\'t stand pictures hanging
> askew on a wall; Venetian blinds that are lower on one end than the
> other, neckties that hang askew. If the tree we planted has started to
> lean, we drive a stake beside it and tie it up straight.
>
> You\'ve all seen and probably have a copy of Muybridge\'s *The Human
> Figure in Motion*. Muybridge knew the value of using vertical and
> horizontal lines behind all of his photographs so any deviation of
> angle could easily be seen. I submit that without those lines the
> untrained eye would miss a great many of the vital angles that was and
> is necessary to enact those actions and poses.
>
> I have pointed out many times in the drawing class, there is a
> compulsive urge to straighten up the model\'s pose. The whole purpose
> of a gesture class is to nurture the ability to capture those subtle
> angles and tensions that makes the pose enjoyable, picturesque,
> charming, unique; or whimsical, humorous; or even sad or wretched.
>
> Try this---whenever you make a sketch, keep a mental vertical line
> going through the figure somewhere. Realize that even this is an
> angle---it is a 90-degree right angle to the horizontal plane. Any
> deviation from this (in mathematical terms) would be an obtuse or an
> acute angle. In drawing, this deviance would set up a tension. Or to
> put it in less formal terms, it is what we humans use in our body
> language. And body language, simply put, is our every day form of
> acting. As animators, acting is our business.

## Tennis and Angles

> One thing is for sure: to acquire a certain degree of skill or
> expertise in any undertaking, the basics must be studied and
> conquered. Drawing, animation specifically, is no exception. Once the
> basic rules and principles are thoroughly ingrained, they can be
> applied to all the variations of problems that will confront us---and
> confront us they will.
>
> The game of tennis has a few basics that when once learned are
> applicable throughout the game. For instance once you learn what a
> "forehand drive" is, you soon realize that that shot doesn't cover
> just one tiny area of the total. It covers any ball that comes to your
> right side (If you're right handed), anywhere from the ankles up to
> around head height, providing it bounces once on the court before it
> gets to you. Beginners who are not yet aware of this as a category of
> shot will be confused, because it comes at them anywhere from the
> center of the body to way beyond their reach, and as I mentioned, from
> the ankle to head height. It's like being "splayed" by a machine gun
> of tennis balls. You may find a waist shot at arms length fairly easy
> to handle, but these things are coming at you like swallows entering
> their nesting place at sundown.
>
> So you study and learn this one stroke, the "forehand drive" which
> requires one particular "principle" of stroking, more or less. Just
> knowing that much makes it easier to adjust to the variety of heights
> and distances and speeds of balls, so you can adapt your body
> movements, weight distribution, speed of racket, footwork, etc.
> Anything over the head merges into the area of an "overhead"
> shot---that requires a technique of its own.
>
> Anything that bounces just before you hit it is a "half volley" shot
> that has its own rules for handling. The forehand drive is just one of
> many shots a tennis player should have in his arsenal of shots.
>
> I didn't mean to bore you, but I thought it might illustrate the fact
> that knowing a particular problem so you can deal with it on its own
> terms makes sense. It takes all the mystery and the confusion out of
> it. It allows one to isolate a problem and to work on it alone and by
> repetitive practice, "groove" it to perfection, and to learn it so
> well that it becomes second nature---not that you won't have to think
> anymore, but that thinking about it will not cause you to lose your
> main trend of thought, which of course in animation is acting out your
> character part on paper.
>
> To avoid belaboring those rules too much, let's use angles as an
> illustration of a "stroke" in our arsenal of shots. Every gesture or
> pose is loaded with angles, but if they are not- recognized as
> potential point winners, we might just gloss over them. I don't want
> you to gloss over that word gloss either---it means superficial
> quality or show---a deceptive outward appearance---to make an error
> seem right or trivial. If we gloss over enough of those kinds of
> drawing "strokes," we'll end up with a "love game," in other words a
> nothing drawing.
>
> Back to angles. If you want to make a strong statement (and even
> subtle poses and actions can be strong statements), pay special
> attention to angles. Especially if you work roughly, then "clean" your
> drawings up later (after the initial spurt of enthusiasm and clarity
> of vision has left you). Then later a cleanup person will work on it,
> who never had
>
> your enthusiasm or clarity of vision, and perhaps soften the angles
> just a little more. Your accolades will be soft too, for it is the
> strong statements that get the oohs and aahs.
>
> Sometimes when drawing from the model, the angles are just barely
> discernible and so need special attention to find. Once found they
> need accenting to make sure they are still subtle, but at the same

## Straight against Curve: Squash and Stretch in the Pose

> Simply put, a straight line is the symbol for a stretch, and a bent or
> folded line is the symbol for a squash. So whether the action is a
> broad stretch of the arm and body, or a subtle stretch on a face cause
> by a smile or an open mouth, the symbols are applied to the anatomy to
> put these ideas over.
>
> In quick, \"first-impression\" gesture drawing, two lines is all you
> need to locate and suggest the various parts of the arms and
> legs---preferably one straight line on the stretch side and one curved
> line on the squash side.
>
> In every move a figure (human or cartoon) makes its adjustments in the
> various parts or groups of parts to pull off the move. Usually a
> preparation or anticipation precedes the move and more than likely
> involves a squash, plus the distribution of weight to intensify the
> thrust of the move. The move or action itself usually is a stretch.
> But even in an extreme squash drawing, some parts have to stretch to
> get into that position.
>

>
> The principles involved are simple and obvious and are applicable to
> any action. If the body leans forward to grasp some object with its
> outstretched hand, there must be stretch, and there must be an
> adjustment in weight distribution such as counterbalancing with the
> opposite arm, or placing one foot closer to the object than the other
> to keep the body balanced.
>
> There are other things which will contribute to the reach also. Eye
> contact with the object funnels the attention to the reason for the
> action, keeping the path between the hand and the object, and the eyes
> and the object, clear of any obstruction; opening the hand in
> anticipation for the grasp. Timing which we can\'t depict in a sketch,
> but which we should feel, is also important. It will be different for
> delicately picking up the object as opposed to seizing it in a broad
> sweep of the arm, plus of course the continual redistribution of
> weight, and the choice of which part of the move will be reserved for
> the extreme extreme.

## Recreating the First Impression

> The practical application of the ability to isolate the elements of a
> scene, or in your case, a posing figure, is to quickly analyze the
> components of the pose and to put them all back together again into a
> good, strong first impression, any part of which you can call to mind
> for reference as your drawing proceeds.
>
> Depending on the purpose, or meaning, or story behind the gesture, you
> will search the figure for (not necessarily in this order)
>
> x The overall structural personality or character (tall, thin,
> graceful, soft, doll-like, comical, etc.)
>
> x The essence of the gesture (the one-pose story, how this particular
> figure enacts this particular pose, the feeling it evokes). You may
> want to refer back many times to that feeling, it is important.)
>
> x The rules of perspective, mentally superimposing them on the figure
> to locate them there
>
> Then file the findings in your short term memory for handy reference.
> Especially hone in on the all important angles and any, squash and
> stretch. This may all sound very complex, but it all happens in a
> split second.
>
> Once these things are established in the mind, you can go back to the
> whole figure and start drawing. If you bog down in some area, don't
> fight it---simply switch modes and call up that first impression for
> just long enough to revitalize your original intentions. This kind of
> drawing is, in a sense, finished before you start, so there is less
> struggling during the crucial periods of drawing. It frees you of
> laborious deliberations, vacillations, backtracking, and getting
> sidetracked. This is not to say any new information coming to light
> should not be considered, but only in so far as it is relevant and
> will help your first impression.
>
> In animation you usually have one thing to say at a time so everything
> on your drawing should relate to that one thing. Forming a good first
> impression will establish that one thing, and keeping it in the
> forefront of your mind will keep you on the right path.
>
> Simplicity will prove to be one of your best allies, both in your
> concept of the gesture and in the process of drawing it.
>
> The first impression is the right brain's summation of all that lies
> before it. Often as the drawing proceeds, the left brain will want to
> step in and have you start drawing all the details---the buttons, the
> stitching, the pockets, or some piece of clothing that for no
> particular reason has formed a little bump. You don't have to waste
> any energy fighting such temptations - just press the "CLEAR" button
> and your first impression will flash back on the screen again with all
> the consequential information, the strong angles, the simple shapes,
> the squashes and stretches, etc.
>
> You don't have to "put the left brain down." Relegate to it a job like
> switching back to the first impression every minute or two---it is
> eager to help (it thinks it can draw better than the right brain), but
> if you allow it to dominate it will copy what is before it,
> insignificant details and all. Both sides of the brain are eager to
> help, but you have to let them know what *you* want.

> While watching the finals of a tennis tournament between Agassi and

1.  to capture the action itself, and

2.  to draw the player's identity in the action (that is, so they could
    > be identified as those two players).

> I can only guess at the time involved---perhaps one hundredth of a
> second to analyze the gesture and from between 15 and 45 seconds to

## Habits to Avoid

> The study we are involved in is gesture, and is designed to help us
> when the need arises (which is on practically every drawing) in
> animation. It seems that old seducing habits prevail when new goals
> are not clearly stated, re-stated and kept constantly in mind.
>
> Some of those old habits or tendencies that are likely to creep into
> one\'s drawings are:

1.  Thick and thin lines. They are hard to perform with a ball point
    > pen---which is one reason why we are using them. I think a heavy
    > line is fine to emphasize a tension, or thrust, or a pull, if it
    > serves to delineate the gesture, but not for the purpose of
    > creating a shadow or to balance a lopsided drawing, or for
    > texture.

2.  Shading. Shading may enhance a gesture in a painting or a rendered
    > drawing, but the animator does not enjoy the luxury of such
    > devices---best to reserve shading for portrait study.

3.  Putting more details in one area than others. Sometimes one becomes
    > fascinated by some detail, or the mind wanders or is marking time
    > somewhere on the drawing. Or perhaps it is an attempt to raise the
    > whole drawing up into the minor masterpiece level. Sufficient for
    > it to be a simple gesture drawing.

4.  Adding texture under the pretext of locating key points in the
    > drawing, such as the positions of outstretched hands or feet, or
    > dots that profess to locate balance or other alignments. This
    > becomes obvious when there are a lot of marks where there are no
    > key points. Sometimes a stipple effect is charming in
    > illustrations for children\'s books and other stylized drawings.
    > Spattering with a pen is a much used technique in ink drawings.
    > Watercolorists often throw spatterings and drippings of paint by
    > flicking their brushes at their paintings. It adds a kind of loose
    > and exciting texture, and also suggests the artist was so inspired
    > and exuberant in getting down his creative impulses that he was
    > lost in a flurry of involvement ---heedless of his surroundings,
    > the time, the heat, the mosquitoes, and neatness was far from his
    > mind. This is not to suggest that animators should not become
    > exuberant and totally involved, but for our study purposes we need
    > to direct our attention to our particular goal.

5.  One of the most offensive habits is putting down lines simply to get
    > lines down. For instance tossing in a couple of lines for legs
    > with no thought of which leg is supporting most of the weight of
    > the body. It takes no longer to draw the lines in the right
    > attitude --- it just takes a little prior observation and thought.

6.  The same goes for a multitude of lines where one line would have
    > done the trick, which could have been avoided with a little more
    > searching out the gesture before the pen or pencil is applied.

7.  This one is not a devious way to achieve a nice looking drawing but
    > it is a sure way to miss the gesture: drawing down one side of the
    > body or working on isolated areas with no thought of their
    > correlative opposite. One should never draw one elbow, or hand, or
    > knee, or foot without considering the relationship to its
    > opposite. I should say to its \"companion part\" for all joints
    > and parts work in conjunction with their counterpart. They are
    > either complementing, balancing, opposing, or in some way relating
    > to one another.

8.  One of the commonest techniques used to accomplish what \"seems\" to
    > be gesture drawing is copying the model. An artist who has drawn a
    > lot and has good hand/eye coordination, can simply by
    > multitudinous looks at the model and back to his drawing,
    > reproduce fairly accurately what is before him---without ever
    > noticing or feeling the gesture. This is almost like photography.
    > Later, of course, when one is called upon to draw Mickey or Donald
    > or say a mermaid in some particular gesture, there will be nothing
    > to copy or \"photograph.\" One may be required to conjure up a
    > multitude of gestures, heaven forbid, from one\'s imagination.

> So there in eight nutshells (an incomplete list, to be sure) are some
> tricks we need not concern ourselves with in the study of gesture We
> are not striving for drawings that say, \"Look at me, aren\'t I an
> attractive drawing?\" but that will say, \"I have life, and feeling,
> and purpose\", and the drawing will reveal that purpose.

## It Ain't Easy

> In drawing one must continually run through the list of prerequisites
> for making a successful drawing. There is the brief study to grasp a
> first impression, then the start of the sketching---the size, the
> pose, the perspective (including overlap, diminishing size, surface
> lines, foreshortening); anatomy, squash and stretch, angles,
> tension---then back through the list again, perhaps in a different
> order, depending on the needs of the drawing at that particular stage.
> But always back to the first impression lest the drawing be allowed to
> drift off into \"justa drawing.\" So, in driving, one has constantly
> in mind the destination lest one ends up just driving around.
>
> Drawing may be compared to driving a car. While driving there are a
> number of things that need to filter through the consciousness and be
> constantly monitored: destination, steering, judging distances and
> speeds of other cars; working the gas pedal, the brakes or the clutch;
> being in the right lane at the right time; checking the panel for gas,
> temperature, oil; seat belt, sun visor, etc.
>
> One must visualize the ideal drawing (gesture) and then monitor the
> progress and state of the drawing in order to keep steering it in that
> direction. Hopefully, the analysis of the pose to acquire the first
> impression was a good one.
>
> Talking oneself through the drawing is one technique. You might say,
> as your pen or pencil busies itself with your orders and desires,
> \"Let\'s see, do I have enough straights, enough curves; should I
> strengthen these angles? What can I do about this tangent? My first
> impression was thus and so---am I sticking with it? I will stress this
> tension; accent the lift or the stretch. How can I make this clearer?
> And so on.\"
>
> This may sound like an overly involved process just to get a gesture
> drawing down on a piece of blank paper, but, you see this is not just
> any old gesture drawing---this is the one you are working on now, at
> this moment of your life. You don\'t want to toss it off casually as
> if it were less important than another. Until all---and I mean
> all---of these prerequisites for a good drawing become second nature,
> some method has to be used to make sure each of these things are
> attended to. Just as you wouldn\'t think of driving a car without
> checking the fuel, planning your route, and for sure, tuning the radio
> to your favorite station.
>
> \"It ain\'t easy,\" as Ollie Johnston said. It requires a lot of
> thought and loving attention. Bill Berg said, \"I love to draw.\" Did
> he not speak for all of us? So in animation there is not just one pose
> to \"lovingly\" attend to, but hundreds---eventually thousands of such
> poses. So added to the above list of prerequisites are endurance,
> \"stick-to-itiveness\" and a sustained enthusiasm---things which in
> themselves require a special nurturing.
>
> It might seem that all this mental manipulation might impede the
> so-called creative side of drawing, because all these rules and the
> overseeing is a left brain activity. But left to its own, the right
> brain may take off into some Picasso-like freedom and we end up with
>
> some \"creative\" but inappropriate drawing. We must be creative
> within the bounds of our media, so it is legitimate to call upon the
> left brain to help out in that respect.
>
> Most important to the success of a drawing is that first impression.
> If it is perceived wrongly, the preliminary sketch will be off and all
> the work put in it from then on will be a waste. You may think I\'m
> being overly hard-headed about this---after all, if you finish the
> drawing and it looks nice, what the heck? The point is, you want to

> Gesture Drawing For Animation

# *Chapter 6: Pushing the Gesture*

> In cartoon animation we often push the gestures so far they become a
> caricature. We need to not only capture our first impression, but
> perhaps even push it a little further.
>
> Any of you who have used live action in animation know the devastating
> effects of copying and tracing. I have seen scenes where the
> Photostats had been practically traced, and the scene was lifeless.
> One of the reasons for this is that live action actors do not move
> from extreme to extreme as animation characters do. Studying live
> action clips will reveal that many actors mince through their parts
> like a cloud changing shapes in a breezy sky. Often though, actors are
> used whose gestures are broad and crisp, making the animators\' job
> much easier.
>
> What is acceptable for live action becomes bland, vapid and
> uninteresting when traced into line. Here is where your ability to
> understand and draw gestures really hits pay dirt. There has to be an
> appropriate interpretation and restatement into a cartoon style. The
> term "caricature" pretty well explains the transformation. In class,
> you should strive for a release from the live-action-ness of the model
> and extract from it, not what it is, but what it is doing---the same
> as you would while sitting at an animation desk working on a scene.
>
> Here is a photograph of a chap picking up a box. The drawing next to
> it is a tracing, while the rest of the sketches were done (albeit,
> crudely), to demonstrate how slightly caricaturing the action can
> bring out different nuances of the pose without drastically changing
> the original pose. A Mickey and a Goofy were added also to show a
> possible application of such a pose in a scene of animation.

## Drawing Gesture from the Model

> The action is the thing here. There is absolutely no sense in trying
> to get a likeness, that is, a cosmetic likeness, or a personality
> likeness. The essence of femininity, yes, the essence of a coy or
> seductive pose, yes.
>
> Don't be shackled by the model. If the model is short and you want to
> draw a tall girl, draw a tall girl; if the model's hair is short and
> you want long hair, draw long hair. If the model strikes a pose you
> think you could improve by altering a little here or there, do it on
> your drawing.
>
> Take a moment before you start to see the pose. Feel yourself
> experiencing the pose subconsciously. Actually feel the tension of a
> reach, the folding up sensation of a squash; feel the pressure on the
> leg that the body is standing on, the weight of the body on that foot;
> feel the relaxation of the other leg show it relaxed to emphasize the
> tension and weight on the other side. The model's head is turned to
> the right, turn your own head to the right---feel the wrinkling of the
> skin as the chin squashes against the right shoulder - feel the left
> side of the neck stretch. That is what you want to draw---that squash
> and stretch.
>
> After capturing the pose, begin to consider what effect that pose has
> on the costume. The idea being that you don't animate clothing running
> around doing its thing---you animate a character that is a body, which
> just happens to have some clothes on it.
>
> If you want to experiment and use a cartoon character in place of the
> human figure that is fine. In any event try to caricature the pose,
> meaning go a little farther with the pose than the model has done (or
> even could do---not being a cartoon character).

## Stick to the Theme

> An orchestra conductor, in a discussion on conducting Mahler\'s 1^st^
> symphony, said he had to be careful not to have too many climaxes in
> the performance. It is a relatively long symphony, 55 minutes in
> length, and is full of delightful passages that could be featured each
> in their own right. But there needs be control over such a temptation
> so that the overall theme of each of the three movements shall
> prevail.
>
> Drawing is like that. We are the conductors who are tempted also to
> feature the many interesting passages on the model. Some passages---a
> wrinkle, a belt buckle, a hair do, are sensuous to the point where we
> want to render them into little masterpieces of non- essential detail.
> Usually, a drawing has but one theme, and that theme must be featured
> or the drawing disintegrates into a montage of unrelated climaxes.
>
> There is a story to be told in drawing, whether it is one drawing of a
> model or many drawings in a scene of animation. True, in both cases
> there are secondary actions and costuming that must be dealt with, but
> the story (theme) is all important, while all else must be kept in a
> subordinate role. Subordinate doesn\'t mean unimportant. Everything on
> the drawing is there to help stress the story. Every line drawn should
> help direct the eye to the theme.

> Every scene of animation and every single drawing have a theme upon
> which the viewers\' attention should be directed. Every line in the
> drawing must help.
>
> It is much more difficult in music and literature. To keep a central
> motif going in music for 55 minutes takes some advanced know-how and
> discipline. An author has a similar problem. Whether writing a love
> story or a psychic thriller, the words chosen are like the lines we
> use in drawing---they help reveal and build the substance of the
> theme. A wrong choice of words or phrases will spoil the mood. Things
> that are not basic to the story (plot, mood or gesture) have to be

>
> Here are two sketches from the drawing class that illustrate the

> The second drawing immediately centers your attention on the story. A

> that it has not reached its destination yet which is commensurate with
> the throwing arm still at its extreme position. His body is bent
> forward and down from the forward thrust of the toss, causing another
> secondary action, the belly-hanging-over- the-belt bit. The straight
> of the right leg plus the force exerted by the left leg, along with

> even the unseen face, open a \"passage\" (one of Don Graham\'s
> favorite words) for the attention of the viewer

> to dwell on, or pass through. That is where the story is being told,
> and every line in the drawing is contributing to it.
>
> So drawing is not just recording a leg here, an arm there, a head and
> hands, etc. A drawing is like a parable, which is a story told to
> convey a lesson. If the story reveals the meaning of the lesson it is
> a success, but if it is just a cute story, it falls short of its
> reason for being.

## Subtlety

> Consider the normal upright standing position. It is not what you
> ordinarily think of as an action but actually, to stand is an action.
> Stand is a verb. Just think of what you have to go through to remain
> standing. There is constant muscular adjustment, and according to our
> individual physical structure, our attitude and the conditions around
> us cause everyone\'s \"stand\" to be slightly different.
>
> It is utterly impossible for a person to do nothing. So in effect
> every position a person gets into is a pose. There\'s a challenge for
> you whenever you are drawing---though the figure seems to be doing
> nothing, such is not the case. You must sometimes seek out very subtle
> nuances to capture the pose or gesture.
>
> When you begin to radiate out in all directions from that upright
> pose---into the millions of variations of poses and gestures the human
> figure can assume---it seems to get easier. It seems like instead of
> shooting an arrow at a tiny target, it\'s more like shooting it at the
> \"broad side of a barn.\" But it just seems that way. There are as
> many if not more subtleties in a broad pose as there are in a subdued
> one. It may not take as much concentration to draw an action pose as a
> subtle standing pose, for you can get away with more. But if you apply
> the same effort in seeking out the subtleties of a broad pose as you
> must do for a less active one, you would end up with a really nice
> drawing, not merely a recognizable action.
>
> So don\'t settle for merely recognition---go for the subtleties. If
> you are animating and leaving those subtleties for the cleanup person
> to find, you are expecting quite a bit. A cleanup person should be
> skilled enough to \"cover\" you, but it is usually enough for the
> cleanup people to hang on to whatever the animator has drawn.
>
> If you are a cleanup person---it behooves you to train yourself in
> those subtleties, so when they are needed in a scene of
> animation---you are ready. And willing, let me add. Cleaning up may
> not have the most glamorous aura about it, but it is an integral part
> of animation. After all, yours are the actual drawings that are seen
> on the screen. It is my contention that is easier to animate a loosely
> drawn character in a scene than it is to clean it up. On the other
> hand, if the animator has worked clean and has all the subtleties
> carefully drawn, then the cleanup person\'s job is a cinch---gravy.

## Pushing the Gesture

> Here are some quick sketches done in class by Broose Johnson. They are
> simple in style and capture the essence of the pose with an economy of
> line, and as you might guess, in a very few seconds. Notice how in
> group 1, Broose got more twist in the second try by opening up the
> armhole of the dress, bringing the breast into view, sending the V of
> the dress farther around, breaking the silhouette with the hair, and
> adding a wrinkle from the left hip to the right shoulder.
>
> In group 4, note how in the drawing on the right, the tension was
> increased between the heads and shoulders, causing a feeling of
> movement. A more acute angle on the girl's upper body allowed her hair
> to hang down---a nice touch. Note the improved negative space between
> the heads. That same area in the drawing on the left is slightly
> static---it repeats the perpendicular angles of the body and arm of
> the girl.

## Action Analysis: Hands & Feet

> representation of an action, or of a character, a mood, or a gesture.
>
> To emphasize the importance of the above premise I have selected some

> showing the head and torso, one showing the lower legs and feet plus
> the lower arms and hands. I submit that the latter drawings explain

## Lazy Lines

> While talking to Dan Jeup one day, he mentioned \"lazy lines.\" He was
> referring to lines that didn\'t describe anything, Things like shape,
> texture, softness or hardness. It\'s like what you get when you trace
> something, an overall sameness of line. Granted, when you are using a
> mechanical pencil as we are on \"Mermaid,\" that in itself cuts down
> on possible variations of line. However, the problem of lazy lines
> goes deeper than just the surface patina; it has to do with the lack
> of basic drawing.
>
> For instance, the same pencil makes a line for a bird\'s beak as for
> its feathers. If the artist does not feel the difference and try to
> inject that feeling into the drawing, then both lines will look
> alike---lazy lines. And incidentally, they will look like a tracing.
>
> Many factors go into the drawing of any part of a bird, and the mind
> must be focused on each thing separately yet simultaneously. A Zen
> saying may help to clarify what I am trying to say: \"When I am
> walking, I am walking; when I am eating, I am eating.\" It simply
> means that when you are walking, enjoy the fact, instead of planning
> what you are going to do about the rent payment or what you should
> have said during yesterday\'s discussion on politics. Now is the only
> moment you have---live in it. Someone said, \"Thank God we only live
> one moment at a time---we couldn\'t handle any more than that.\"
>
> Back to walking. When I am walking, I am (just) walking. I feel the
> cool breeze or the soothing warmth of the sun; I hear whatever sounds
> pass into my consciousness; I feel my heels strike the ground as they
> make contact; I enjoy the sway of my body as it negotiates for balance
> and forward motion; I watch the scenery go by and am aware of the
> three-dimensional quality unfolding around me. These factors are all
> happening simultaneously yet can be enjoyed separately. The same goes
> for every activity of your daily living. It is possible to go through
> life (or sometimes just big chunks of it) in a sort of dream state
> wherein you don\'t really experience the things you do. And so it is
> possible to make a drawing (many drawings) without being wholly
> conscious of what you are drawing.
>
> To apply that philosophy to drawing, you simply have to realize: when
> you are drawing a beak, you are drawing a beak; when you are drawing a
> feathered head, you are drawing a feathered head. And that goes for
> any of the hundreds, or will it be thousands, of separate parts you
> will be called upon to draw. This may seem contrary to my usual
> preaching about not drawing details in the gesture class. It is a
> matter of sequence---first the rough gesture drawing, then the detail.
> The line used to lay in the pose or action (acting) can be all one
> kind of line, as long as it is flowing, expressive, flexible,
> searching, and basic. The line to \"finalize\" the drawing must
> describe the shape, texture, and malleability of each part. So when
> drawing a bird\'s beak, you should aspire to make the drawing say
> \"beak.\" When you get to the feathered part of the bird, you shift
> gears or press the, \"When I am drawing feathers, I am drawing
> feathers\" button.
>
> I fully realize the pressure levied on you by the production
> schedules, but it really takes but a split second to alter your
> thinking as you move from one texture or shape to another. Just being
> aware of what you are drawing will help to elevate your line from
> \"lazy\" to \"expressive.\"

> model sheet of a cartoony character, and clip it to the top of your
> drawing board where it will be visible at all times. Transfer the
> gestures of the live model onto the production model.
>
> This will give you an opportunity to break away altogether from
> copying the details of the live model. Try to capture the pose the
> live model is offering you but just "throw in" the shapes and costume
> of the production model. Don\'t get involved in detail or "cleanup."
> At first you may think this is a waste of a perfectly good live model,
> but as you get with it, I think you'll find it to be a revelation. It
> might even become addictive.
>
> Do not attempt to copy anything on the live model except the gesture,
> and do not try to copy anything specific off the model sheet---just
> sketch in the most general terms.
>
> Occasionally a bit of live action film is used as source material for
> animation. Since it is impossible to find actors who are constructed
> like the cartoon characters, the animator has to extract the essence
> of the action from the film or Photostat and transfer that to the
> drawings. It takes a kind of "double vision"---you are looking at the
> live action but you are seeing the cartoon character. You may be
> looking at a person seven heads tall but drawing a cartoon character
> three or four heads tall. It requires a special knack---but it is a
> learnable knack.
>
> In the early \'30s when the use of live action was first tried, it was
> a period of discovery, a period of great excitement. That discovery is
> history, and now each artist has to discover for themselves the merits
> and even the necessity of using live action, whether in the form of
> live models, film clips or Photostats. After all, all cartoon
> characters, no matter how cartoony, are built on human traits or
> attributes.
>
> Learning to see in this "double vision" can be fun. In their book *The
> Illusion of Life*, Ollie and Frank state, "And the spirit of fun and
> discovery was probably the most important element of that period."
> Don't let the statement, "that period" squelch your spirit of
> discovery, pursuit and involvement.
>
> Again I quote from the *The Illusion of Life*, "But whenever we stayed
> too close to the Photostats, or directly copied even a tiny piece of
> human action, the results looked very strange. The moves appeared real
> enough, but the figure lost the illusion of life Not
>
> until we realized that photographs must be redrawn in animatable
> shapes, (our proven tools of communication) were we able to transfer
> this knowledge to cartoon animation. It was not the photographed
> action of an actor's swelling cheek that mattered, it was the animated
> cheek in our drawings that had to communicate. Our job was to make the
> cartoon figure go through the same movements as the live actor, with
> the same timing and the same staging, but, because animatable shapes
> called for a difference in proportions, the figure and its model could
> not do things in exactly the same way. The actor's movements had to be
> reinterpreted in the world of our designs and shapes and forms."

## Caricature

> In drawing from the model, there is a tendency to draw the ideal
> figure, the one that frequents the anatomy books and the ones we clip
> or Xerox and pin up above our desks. Instead, take advantage of the
> variety of subjects in your sketching sessions. Capture those
> distinguishing features in your drawing. This one has a large
> mid-section with a receding chin. This one is tall or paunchy or
> lithe. His body tapers down to tiny ankles that seem incongruously
> inadequate to carry the weight. This one is chunky, even muscular, but
> dainty in movement---even graceful.
>
> The same applies to heads. The model may have a pinched nose, a double
> chin, baggy jowls, a long upper lip, beady eyes or a low forehead.
>
> Should we not keep these things in mind rather than deltoids, ulnas
> and the 7-heads tall syndrome? As Robert Henri said, "Seeing into the
> realities---beyond the surfaces of the subject."
>
> These are the things that help determine and emphasize the gesture.
> Even as the structure of the body determines the possibilities and the
> uniqueness of a gesture, so with the construction of the head and the
> features of the face, especially if those features can be recognized
> and caricatured.
>
> Don Graham said, "It isn't how well we draw the joints or the
> different parts of the anatomy, but how well you know where they are,
> how they relate and how they work. That's the important thing." And as
> Woolie Reitherman said, "Get the spirit of the thing. That's the most
> important and then after that you can add to it." Ward Kimball said if
> he could take something apart and put it back together again, he could
> draw it. Perhaps we could approach drawing the head in that way. If we
> could analyze the construction of the head, the types of features and
> the meaning of the gesture, we could draw it.
>
> In animation, the ideal model sheet is one that clearly describes the
> head shape and the features. The proportions and types of features are

> extremes one might go to in animating that character. Even then, it is
> not easy. And it is less easy with a live model. Here it is up to us

# *Chapter 7: Principles of Animation*

## Drawing Principles

> Drawing is a lot like mathematics: there are certain rules or
> principles to be followed. A simple rule gives you the answer to 2 x
> 4, and the same rule gives you the answer to 24759 x
> 684393867540027485. The rules are quite simple, but if a person
> ignores them or misuses them, the effects are going to be pretty
> dreary.
>
> Learning how to apply the principles of drawing is a little more
> complex because there is a wider scope of problems to apply the
> principles to. We are often faced with a problem (perhaps it doesn't
> seem like a problem at the time---someone else has to see it and point
> it out to us) and we blunder on in the name of free expression
> forgetting that it requires one of those principles to properly put
> over the point. For instance, stretch. Stretch is not just used in
> extreme cartoony stretches. There are probably stretches in every
> drawing you'll ever make---subtle ones. Every time something (an arm,
> a mouth, the whole side of the body) is extended beyond its normal
> length, that is a stretch. And it should be thought of and treated
> like one. Every drawing you'll ever make will have an eye level and
> consequently a vanishing point, and all the other elements of the
> principles of perspective. No matter how imaginative your drawing
> assignment is, you have to rely on a communicable use of the
> principles of good drawing.
>
> When in the class someone draws an arm with a nice sleeve and nice
> wrinkles in the cloth and nicely rendered fingernails, I have to say,
> "Hey, you've drawn an arm---what you should have drawn is a stretch."
> The thing is with mathematics, if you don't use the rules, your books
> won't balance or your bridge will fall or your building will topple.
> In drawing, you'll just have a drawing that somehow doesn't look
> right. It'll carry the scene (just barely) but no one's going to
> *oooh* and *ahhh* at it.
>
> Would it be plausible to try to liken drawing to the science of cause
> and effect? Let's say the principles of drawing are the cause of a
> good drawing and when those principles are used, the resultant effect
> is a good drawing. Often you can get a good effect by simply searching
> around, or by accident, but when you're after a specific effect, the
> principles are the shortest distance between the two points.
>
> I'm not saying that using the principles of good drawing is going to
> take the place of creative thinking---those are two separate things
> which are dependent on each other. You may be able to identify every
> muscle in the body, be able to expound at length on the principles of
> drawing, but without that under girding of creativity (of which acting
> is a big part) you'll probably rarely come up with a good effect. On
> the other hand if you're real creative you'll need some of that other
> stuff to back you up. You'll probably come closer to a good effect
> with a heavy emphasis on creativity---but you will then have to have
> an extra good cleanup person to put the finishing touches to it.
>
> So technical knowledge and creative thinking are your two big guns.
> Stay with their development until they are part of you, and can be
> called up at will, when needed.

## 28 Principles of Animation

> ![](vertopal_b37bd7c03c234a8aad2387e1c8154157/media/image255.png){width="2.5459623797025372in"
> height="2.862470472440945in"}There are some principles of animation
> that can be consciously used in any scene. I have listed 28
> principles--- though there well may be more. Most of them apply to
> still drawing also---such as those made from a model.
>
> Having 28 principles suggests that a hell of a lot of thinking and
> planning goes into a drawing. It may seem mind boggling--- something
> like trying to corral a dozen frightened deer. But once you get the
> knack, it\'s really quit a lot of fun.
>
> To illustrate these principles, I have chosen a supposedly simple
> scene. When the scene is analyzed, it is apparent how far one may go
> in using these principles. The action in
>
> this scene is quite broad, making the principles easy to find, but
> they should be applied to subtle scenes (actions) also. The use of
> held drawings and moving holds can be very effective, but only if they
> contain the vitality of an action drawing. Again, the use of these
> principles makes that possible.
>
> The purpose of studying and analyzing a scene like this is to acquaint
> oneself with the possibilities in the use of the principles of
> animation. At first these will have to be used consciously, then
> hopefully in time will become second nature. These are the tools of
> animation and should be incorporated whenever possible. Some of them
> may be accidentally stumbled upon while animating in an emotional
> spurt. But when the emotions are lax, knowing these principles will
> enable the artist to animate his scene intellectually, logically and
> artistically as well as emotionally.

## Drawing Calories

> Lots of people are calorie conscious these days. Why not artists too?
> A calorie as applied to food refers to its heat producing or energy
> value. This simply means that the foods we eat both maintain the body
> and supply the energy needed to carry out our daily chores. It takes
> just so many calories to keep a person vigorous in mind and body.
> There are charts available that indicate the caloric values of the
> various foods and drinks.
>
> So why not a calorie chart for drawings? Let's say it takes around
> 2,000 drawing calories to make a healthy, vigorous drawing.

  **Drawing element**            **\"Caloric\" value**
  ------------------------------ -----------------------
  Squash and stretch             500
  Anatomy                        300
  Angles                         300
  Straight against curved line   300
  Gesture                        750
  Overlap                        500\*
  Diminishing size               500\*
  Surface lines                  500\*
  Foreshortening                 300\*

> While animating, you have the advantage of flipping the drawing you
> are working on with the previous extreme, to develop the full effect
> of an action: (Glance back and forth from one drawing to another and

> or primary, action. Everything else becomes a secondary action in some
> degree or another. An animator never allows a secondary action to take
> precedence over the primary action. You might think of the primary

>
> While sketching from a model there is a tendency to think of the pose
> as a still life. For the sake of animation study, think of the pose

> extreme to flip from but you do have that sense of motion to give you
> the feel of what the body went through to get to that pose. This helps
> you to establish the center of interest and to feature or stress the
> important action.
>
> Time and again in class, there has been a pose where the model builds
> a pose around a prop, for instance, opening an umbrella. Five minutes
> into the sketching, out of 17 drawings being made, there might be only
> 3 or 4 umbrellas sketched in. The first impression should be---"woman
> opening umbrella." The center of interest! There should
>
> be an overwhelming obsession to produce a drawing that says "woman
> opening umbrella."
>
> Even after accepting the fact of the center of interest, the battle
> has just begun, and the shortest route to victory is the use of all
> the rules of drawing: perspective, tension, angles, rhythm, squash and
> stretch, etc. Every single line should support the theme and help
> accent the thrust of the action. The feeling of motion, that is the
> building up of physical action to reach that climax of the pose can be
> conjured up mentally and will serve as a previous animation extreme to
> "flip" from in order to reach a dynamic extreme drawing---one that
> says, for instance, \"woman opening umbrella.\"
>
> But whatever the prop or whatever the action, there is a story to be
> told, and a prop definitely suggests a theme. A story sketch man

## Connecting Actions

> For the action study's sake, forget the realism and go for the action.
> I say action rather than pose because although we use poses in
> animation, every pose is in reality an action.
>
> No one ever just does nothing, especially in animation. If there is a
> pose it is either because something has just happened or is about to
> happen. If something funny has just happened, give the audience an
> additional thrill by ending up with a funny pose. If something is
> about to happen, give the audience that superior feeling that they
> have figured out that something is about to happen. In true life, the
> wheels of the mind turn undetected by observers; in cartoons that
> thinking process has to be caricatured. The story line takes care of a
> lot of that but the bulk of it is done visually. That is why we have
> such broad anticipations, "takes," squashes and stretches, arcs,
> slow-ins and slow-outs, follow- throughs and overlaps, and long moving
> holds where you want to build up to some situation or let down from
> one---some pose you want to "milk" for all its worth.
>
> So for the purposes of studying life drawing for animation, one pose
> does not tell enough, because seldom will the animator be faced with
> just a one pose scene. So ideally there should be at least three poses
> to study and portray each action:

1.  The Preparation -- telling the audience something is going to
    > happen,

2.  The Anticipation -- gathering the forces to carry through with the
    > action, and

3.  The Action -- carrying out of the intended action.

> Plus, of course, all the follow-through, overlap and resulting
> residuals---dust, smoke, wind, destroyed property, chaos\... whatever.

# *Chapter 8: A Sense of Story*

## A Sense of Story

> There is something in us, whether it be biological or spiritual that
> urges us to become better \"us\'s\"
>
> Author: Me (Who else would invent a word like \"us\'s\"?)
>
> Drawing a figure (or copying one) just to be drawing a figure can be
> mind-numbing experience. But to draw one that is acting a part in a
> story can be extremely exhilarating. The feeling can be likened to
> acting on the stage and/or writing a story.
>
> Using a touch of story in your drawings can quicken them into
> life---like zapping them with a magic wand.
>
> There\'s no need for a whole story plot for a one drawing story. All
> you need is a character responding characteristically to some real or
> imagined motivation. It has been said that you can\'t save a bad story
> with good animation, but no matter how good a story is, it still takes
> a series of well gestured drawings to capture the interest and
> involvement of the audience.
>
> I think the chapter on story in Thomas\' and Johnston\'s book *Disney
> Animation: The Illusion Of Life* is a reading must for all aspiring
> artists at Disney\'s. I don\'t care how well a person can \"draw,\" if
> he can\'t marry his drawing to the story he is in trouble. The time to
> grasp the importance of the oneness of story and drawing is early on
> in one\'s training. An artist must feel comfortable with interpreting
> a story point, whether it is comical or dramatic.
>
> A drawing class is the perfect setting for experimenting with those
> requirements. We have models who pose as both comical and dramatic. To
> merely copy the model with the same emotional involvement as one might
> copy a recipe is sinful. He/she should \"take the ball and run,\" that
> is, carry the gesture as far (caricature) as possible, always
> conscious of a sense of story.
>
> Call forth a sense of story. Story will bring life to your drawings.
> Story is everything that is taking place in your drawing, especially
> the motivation for the gesture, which isn\'t something that disappears
> after the pose is struck; it is still there activating the muscles
> balancing the figure, causing emotions to emanate from the character
> as he or she playacts to the imaginary audience.
>
> Conjure up a sense of story as you draw. Let it swirl around on the
> page, in and out amongst the lines and shapes, let the story influence
> every mark you make. And, hey, your drawing will come to life before
> your very eyes, and to your utter delight.
>
> When I was young, studying drawing was difficult. The studios where I
> worked didn\'t have life classes, so I copied drawings from anatomy
> books and illustrations from magazines. In those days the magazines
> ran a lot of stories that were profusely illustrated by some A-1
> artists: Mario Cooper, Harvey Dunne, Peter Helck, Wallace Morgan, etc.
>
> But somehow it wasn\'t jelling. I couldn\'t seem to connect with the
> drawings, and with my memory, it was hard to remember what I had
> copied and why. It wasn\'t until I got interested in caption
> cartooning that my study began to make sense. Why? Because I had a
> story to put over (a gag). Now if I had a difficult or special gesture
> to draw, I made many sketches and did some research having a goal. It
> was that sense of story that fired me up and enabled me to grapple
> with gestural problems. Anatomy, size relationships and bodily
> movements seemed to fall into place.
>
> Now I encourage students to have a one drawing story in mind as they
> draw from the model so the essence of that story will project itself
> into their drawing.
>
> Recently we enjoyed a session where the students took turns being the
> model. It\'s good for them to experience that side of classroom
> drawing. It also provides many different characters to draw. I urged
> the students to be aware of the differences: tall, short; thin, plump;
> male, female; husky, frail, etc. I supplied several props each could
> choose for their two short poses. I encouraged them to \"hang loose,\"
> that is, draw loosely and expressively; to concentrate on story,
> rather than on making a photographic copy of the models.
>
> The spirit of this concept caught on like wildfire. As you will see in
> the several drawings that I remembered to \"confiscate,\" the students
> called up some reserve energy and went straight to the essence of the
> story, even adding a little of their own imagination. Check out these

## Acting and Drawing

> Stanislavski, in his book *An Actor Prepares*, said, \"\...the organic
> basis on which our art is founded will protect you in the future from
> going down the wrong path." The "organic basis" he spoke about is that
> emotional empathy and those natural body gestures that we are striving
> to see and know---know in our own bodies and minds so we can transfer
> them to paper. As Stanislavski says, "...if we are not living our art,
> imagination evaporates and is replaced by theatrical claptrap." On
> another page he writes, "...in our art you must live the part every
> moment that you are playing it, and every time."
>
> And on still another page, "You must be very careful in the use of a
> mirror. It teaches an actor to watch the outside rather than the
> inside." In our classroom situation we are not using a mirror, but we
> are using a model, which is no different than a mirror if we merely
> copy it. Stanislavski cautioned, "\...never allow yourself externally
> to portray anything that you have not inwardly experienced and which
> is not interesting to you."
>
> Translating all that to drawing from the model: copying or drawing by
> formula, that is, with anatomical diagrams, symbols of shapes and
> parts, or copying photographically will simply be drawing by the
> numbers. There is indeed a kind of universal "body language," but it
> differs with each person's (or character's) use of it.
>
> Charlie Chaplin's reaction to some particular stimulus such as grief
> or joy might be the same, emotionally, as John Wayne's, but would
> differ greatly gesture-wise. If you attempted to mimic those actors,
> it would come from your mental image of their gestures, with an
> adjustment of your own bodily movements to reproduce theirs. This is
> the very thing we do when drawing a model's gestures, except we don't
> mimic them with our bodies---we use a pen or pencil.
>
> All the above just to say: see it in the mind, and feel it in the body
> before trying to draw it on the paper.

## The Emotional Gesture

> You might think of drawing as composed of two elements of
> life---mental and physical. The physical part is the knowledge of
> anatomy, and the mechanics of how that anatomy works. The other part
> is the mental, which involves the whole gamut of moods and emotions.
> Our job as artists is to somehow tie those two elements together into
> a readable expression of whatever it is we want to illustrate.
>
> In our sessions we emphasize the mood and emotional part of the
> gestures. Needless to say both areas are necessary for a maximum of
> expression. But whereas the mechanical part of anatomy is
> traditionally taught in anatomy classes, the mental and emotional side
> has been left for the artist to develop according to the artists\'
> needs or preference.
>
> Ultimately in animation one must face up to the emotional gesture when
> called upon by the director to interject it into his scenes.
>
> As and example of the marriage of the physical and mental, take the
> breaking of a vase. The physical act of breaking a base can be
> accomplished by simply dropping the vase on a hard surface. But to
> show the emotional reason for breaking the vase would require the
> artist to imagine himself in such an angry state that would cause him
> to break it, and get that feeling into the drawings. Each artist would
> have his own subtle manner of doing it but basically there is a sort
> of universal body language that says \"anger.\"
>
> There is no doubt that there is a physical universe, but we deal with
> it in a mental and emotional way. A physical being without emotions
> would make a lousy roommate. Nor would a scene of one of our
> characters perfectly drawn but without some mental motivation be of
> help to the picture. A roughly drawn scene, off model but containing
> the essence of the storyline would be much more desirable. Then let
> the one who draws so well clean the scene up---but retaining all the
> emotional gesture so vital to the making of a good Disney film.
>
> One night we had an excellent model named Lalla, who acts out little
> one-pose dramas. Lalla\'s pose showed a woman in mental and physical
> agony. One student was making a beautiful drawing that looked like a
> woman in repose. I said, \"Yours is a nice drawing but that pose is a
> Käthe Kollwitz situation.\" He said, \"Who is Käthe Kollwitz?\" She
> was a Prussian artist who grew up in a period of much conflict. She
> lived in Germany during Hitler\'s rise to power, and depicted the
> tragedies and sufferings of the period.

## Common Vs Uncommon Gestures

> At times I may seem to get too involved in subtle and uncommon
> gestures. I defend that habit with the argument that you are doing
> uncommon films. If you were working on Bugs Bunny or the Road Runner,
> or heaven forbid, limited animation, you might get away with about a
> dozen common gestures: mad, surprised, scheming, a squash or stretch,
> anticipations, some crazy takes, a bombed-out pose with lots of smoke,
> and a fast run.
>
> The stories you work on require a more diversified range of emotions
> and a much more sophisticated style for communicating them. The Disney
> style of animation goes beyond the \"stock\" variety. It often
> requires a little introspection---analyzing your own feelings to come
> up with an \"uncommon\" gesture. And at these times it would be well
> if you knew the \"principles\" of drawing I so often speak of, so you
> could get the most out of what you are trying to express. That is also
> why I suggest reading a variety of writers who are able to describe
> that vast range of human emotions you as \"actors\" must deal with.
> Watching movies, not just for enjoyment, but also for study purposes
> is a must.
>
> The old silent movies are especially good because they were acted
> without the \"crutch\" of dialogue to carry the story, or the gags.
> The gestures had to be caricatured with pinpoint accuracy. In these
> present times, good snappy dialogue is \"in\" and very often
> substitutes for good acting or good pantomime. In Disney feature
> cartoons, mushy animation or weak gestures are not so readily
> acceptable. Even with good dialogue to help, the acting has to be
> caricatured---much like the old silent movies. The style of drama and
> humor has changed---but the need for good visual portrayal is still
> needed.
>
> If you neglect to update yourself through the study of good writing,
> movies and plays, your sensitivity to these various emotions will
> surely atrophy. More important than just being able recognize or
> picture in your mind the multitude of body-gestures---you have to be
> able to draw them, and that is why I so often recommend
> sketching---constant sketching. That will keep your mind active,
> inquisitive; your eye sharp, and your drawing dexterity at \"launch
> capability\" at all times.

## Body Language

> Body language is vital to animation. The use of body language in
> visual communication ranges from subtle eye movements to great
> sweeping bodily gesticulations. Each of these movements has meaning
> and has been developed to a high degree of spontaneous understanding
> between people of like cultures.
>
> There are some non-verbal messages that are "universal". These are
> basic human emotions such as joy, sorrow, anger, tenderness,
> submission, domination, fear, surprise, distress, disgust, contempt,
> and shame. It seems these emotions are tied in with the physiological
> structure of humans. Some scientists (who study kinesics) believe that
> the brains of all humans are programmed to react bodily in a similar
> fashion to these emotions.
>
> Other forms of body language are either learned by copying, or by
> strict codes or rules devised by individual cultures. Often these
> gestures are the exact opposite from those of other cultures. For
> instance, nodding the head is our western culture's non-verbal way of
> saying "yes." There are societies in India, however, where a nod of
> the head means "no".
>
> Messages of the body are used to establish one's "space," of which
> there are many kinds---personal, social, public, territorial, etc.
> Body language is used to reveal one's social position, one's attitude,
> and one's needs; also there are gestures of love, friendship, and
> hatred. Gestures are used to create an "image" of self as honest
> (watch the candidates on TV), or sexy, or physical or caring, etc. The
> kinds of gestures and their uses are practically limitless. Every
> gesture we make or contrive is used to explain our thoughts or
> actions, and the degree to which we display the movements establishes
> our character as extrovert or introvert, aggressive or passive,
> thoughtful or insensitive, comical or tragic.
>
> In animation, of course, the story and its characters dictate the
> types of gestures needed. In most cases whatever the character,
> caricaturing the action is necessary to "punch" the business.
> Caricature is the animator's means of making sure there is no doubt in
> the viewer\'s mind what is being portrayed. John Lounsbery animated
> what he thought was a cute Italian gesture for Tony, the waiter, in
> *Lady and the Tramp*. The director, Geronimi, knowledgeable in Italian
> matters, suggested he change it---it happened to be an obscene
> gesture.
>
> Poetry can, for instance, be nebulous and suggestive in order to evoke
> personal images in the mind of the reader, but a cartoon has to "read"
> in an instant---with no need for retrogression. In a film, everything
> unfolds at 24 frames a second and all must be "spelled out" so
> everyone arrives at the ending at the same time and with the same
> conclusion.
>
> Gestures that "ring true" are needed to attain that goal. Practice,
> observation, constant sketching, "osmosis", and even emulation of the
> Disney masters past and present should be among your daily pursuits.
>
> Drawing gestures is like using body language - it requires the context
> of an entire situation (story) to be thoroughly meaningful.
>
> We learn drawing by studying parts; we practice drawing by assembling
> those parts into a meaningful whole.
>
> Here are some drawings from Joe Ranft's sketchbook, done recently on a
> trip to Australia. They are what I call "unselfconscious" gesture
> drawings. As you study them you will see that there was no attempt to
> impose upon them any more than that they
>
> record some activity (body language) in its most direct and simplest
> form. In every drawing he seems to fuse the gesture into the context
> of the situation he has chosen to draw.

## Creative Energy

> I've always been one of those ordinary guys, you know, just a plugger,

> that forward-looking trait, I think it\'s especially important for him
> to have a good solid philosophical and psychological undergirding. The
> word *gird* is very apropos here because it means to prepare (oneself)
> for action.
>
> The action, in our case, is drawing; that impassioned desire to
> express oneself, that urge to create that ingrained need to interpret
> one's surroundings. It is the need to make or create a tiny bit of
> order, it is the need to express some of the myriads of impressions we
> have gathered in all our hours of looking and seeing and observing; it
> is the pleasure that comes from corralling form and content and
> assembling them into a new thing--- preferably something that no one
> else has done before---at least not quite in the same way.
>
> All this takes energy. Energy of a special kind. For an artist, energy
> is in constant use and demand. A gardener cuts his lawns, trims his
> bushes and his work is done---he can go home, open a beer and watch
> TV. A cartoonist or an artist draws all day then goes to a drawing
> class at night or studies a book on anatomy, heads, composition,
> perspective, caricature, acting, or some related subject. If he
> watches TV, he is either sketching the actors or studying the action
> or the way the dialogue is being delivered, thinking how he would have
> improved this or that scene if he were the director. In all his waking
> hours (sometimes in sleep) he is mentally transposing his environment
> into compositions, delineating certain lines, stressing certain
> shapes---working one against another. He talks to someone, missing
> whole sentences while concentrating on how the lines are being
> delivered rather than what is being said.
>
> Clearly and simply, man---and the artist in particular---is a creative
> being. If you take that away from him (or if he relinquishes it
> himself), he is less than his potential. So who
>
> needs potentials? I'll tell you who needs them---you do, I do. This
> world was created by some creative energy (you name it as you see fit)
> and that creative energy that founded it and now runs it, is working,
> in and through you now. Do you not feel that surge of energy and
> awareness tingling at your finger tips and its motor humming away in
> your solar plexus? Is your mind not spinning with thoughts, ideas? Is
> it not always searching, searching, searching?
>
> The awareness of it will be strongest in the springtime when the earth
> around you begins to hum with the renewal of life. But here's the
> wonderful thing---man's renewal is not dependent on springtime. A mere
> rededication to creativity is all man needs to start the creative
> juices flowing and then suddenly there is the energy---energy that
> seems to feed upon itself, so that each moment becomes a fresh start,
> each experience a new event, and the vision is forward-looking with
> anticipation and wonder---not backward looking, full of regrets for
> neglected opportunities of the past, or negative influences that creep
> in and block our vision.
>
> Yes, the action is drawing and the preparation is aligning ourselves
> with that creative energy, becoming a channel through which it can
> find expression. Think of the universe as being full of energy (it is,
> you know) and that energy is swirling around us waiting to take on
> some form. All we have to do is open up our consciousness and allow it
> to enter---and in a way that no one else in the world can, express it.

## Osmosis

> The conscious mind must be selective of the things that vie for one\'s
> attention because it can only process one thing at a time. You could
> liken it to a telephone line where the voice travels over a single
> concentrated vehicle. The conscious mind \"listens in\" to whatever it
> desires to pay attention. The subconscious mind, however, receives an
> unbroken deluge of information, not through a single line but more
> like radio waves which travel in all directions. The subconscious mind
> receives constantly, from all directions, all the information picked
> up by the five senses (and psychically) in the form of subliminal
> \"osmosis\".
>
> Most everyone is acquainted with the classic example where subliminal
> advertisements for coke and popcorn were flashed on the screen
> periodically during the film. Later, some fellow capitalized on the
> method by recording several tapes of a positive thinking and self help
> nature, but with only the sound of waves breaking at the sea shore

>
> The person seeking help listens for an hour a day (or something like
> that) and while the conscious mind is soothed by the wave sounds, the
> subconscious deals with the subliminal suggestions in its mysterious

>
> Besides, it can make life rather pleasant---surrounding yourself with

> I would be amiss if I didn\'t mention mental attitude or physical well
> being, along with some possible means of acquiring and/or maintaining
> it. Much recent research has proven the benefits of pursuing such a
> program.
>
> All of us have experienced periods of diminished energy and
> depression. It is possible to have one or both of them creep upon us
> so slowly that we are unaware of the change, and there we are,
> dragging our (mental and physical) feet. Over a period of time we may
> even come to believe that this is the way life is supposed to be.
> You\'ve heard people when asked, \"How are you?\" answer, \"Okay\",
> meaning of course, not bad enough to say \"Lousy,\" and not good
> enough to say \"Terrific.\"
>
> If I were selling this program of physical and mental betterment for
> money, I would do it on a money-back guarantee basis, because I am
> confident that a little physical and mental gymnastics are necessary
> for an artist\'s well being. Each one has to find his or her approach.
> If you are involved in a sport, and do it fairly often that may be all
> you need. If not, perhaps some simple aerobics will do the trick.
>
> I personally have settled for 25 or 30 minutes of stretching and
> aerobics each morning, plus (when at home) at least one hour of
> competitive tennis (singles) every day. This, plus hikes on the beach
> or in the hills have kept me fairly physically fit. So at 68 I am
> still quite active.
>
> As for food, I am not over zealous about what I put in my body, but I
> am very careful to get enough of the foods which will rebuild the worn
> down parts and to maintain the parts that are working well. That in
> itself takes a little special attention. But in the long run it is
> worth it.
>
> As for mental hygiene, again it must be a personal choice and one
> which helps keep everything in perspective. It may be through the use
> of religious, or a philosophy or yoga, or Zen, whatever it is, it
> should serve to activate the \"juices\" and to stir up the desire to
> improve yourself to reach beyond yourself---beyond where you are now.
> It has to make you want to express yourself (your self), to create.
>
> You must create. The injunction of life is to create or perish. Good
> physical and mental conditioning are necessary to do this. Remember
> this: the creative energy that created the Universe, created you and
> its creative power is in you now, motivating you, urging you on always
> in the direction of creative expression.
>
> I have a formula: \"Impression minus expression equals depression.\"
> This is especially applicable to artists. We have trained ourselves to
> be impressed (aware) of all the things around us, and in the natural
> course of our lives those impressions cry out to be expressed---on
> paper, on canvas, in music, in poetry, in an animated film. So shape
> up!

## The Metaphysical Side

> Certain "new thought" religions have a positive theme running through
> their teachings; they feature life, peace, happiness, health, and.
> success. One way of getting in tune with all this goodness is to start
> the day with a positive affirmation. One might say something like
> this: "Today brings out the best in me, if I bring out the best in
> today."
>
> For artists (animators), drawing takes up a large portion of the day,
> so perhaps a positive statement for making successful drawings would
> be in line. Say: "today's drawings bring out the best in me---if I
> bring out the best in today's drawings." It becomes an expectancy
> factor, and attitude factor, and those two things are a great energy
> source. Athletes usually do better at home games because their home
> fans cheer them on. It helps the team's expectancy/attitude factor.
>
> You as artists don't have bands playing, banners flying, cheerleaders
> or a friendly crowd of admirers to bring you up to creative heights.
> But you can have a quiet, affirmative, efficacious word with yourself
> daily, to make sure all your wheels are on the track.

## Habits

> Arguments against forming daily habits that guide you through life
> without having make any new choices are quite numerous. The old adage
> \"use it or lose it\" is applicable here. If one has formed pretty
> solid days worth of habits that carry him through the days and months
> and years---he is going to grow smaller and smaller as age sets and
> the more habitual he is the sooner age will set in.
>
> Someone said, \"Change will help keep the balance sheets in order,\"
> or something like that. We\'re not talking change for the sake of
> change---but for improvement. For expanding the consciousness, for an
> ever fresh and open-minded attitude to your piece of the universe.
> Habits are a blessing when they relieve us of the burden of having to
> relearn everything we do every day. But if they lead us down the
> narrowing road of complacency, they become a drag.
>
> That great teacher and the great guy, T. Hee, told his students to be
> like a sponge---soak up all the knowledge and information you can.
> Never allow yourself to get into a self- satisfied or complacent
> state. He advised never to drive home from work by the same streets
> twice. Take alternate routes---observe the new houses, trees, gardens,
> and don\'t just drive by them---look at them, see them. When walking
> along a sidewalk, look into the store windows, not just a glance, but
> a good look, to see what\'s there---the set up, the merchandise, the
> signs. Sketch it in the mind\'s eye. Observe passersby. Notice their
> walks, their postures, their rhythms---look for their history on their
> faces. Observe, observe, observe. And of course there is no better way
> to observe than to carry a sketch book with you wherever you go.
>
> Whether your heart is set on the fine arts or on animation, quick
> sketching is the shortest route to training yourself for capturing
> those spontaneous gestures and poses that are so essential to good
> drawing. Break one of your bad habits today. Which one? The habit of
> not sketching.
>
> Also relative to drawing is the sharpening of your sense of dramatics
> and humor and of science and psychology. What are your reading habits?
> If they are narrow and limited, make a determined effort to expand
> them. Read a book on acting. Read a mystery; read a book on the life
> of Pissarro. Have a few books of New Yorker cartoons in your library.
> Read Van Gogh\'s *Dear Theo*. Read a few self-improvement books. Call
> a joke line once in a while. Listen to some jazz, some symphony, a
> string quintet, some country music.
>
> Stop everything and just listen. There are some delightful Irish and
> Scottish recordings. Feel the leaves of a sycamore tree, a wad of
> cotton, a piece of sandpaper. Pick up a stone from the beach or from
> the mountains and fondle it. See if it has a message for you.
>
> Notice its color and texture, imagine doing an abstract painting of
> it, or actually do it. Sharpen your senses in all ways. Life will open
> up its vistas of adventure and courage and adventuresomeness. Then
> when you make a sketch you will feel an authoritative confidence flow
> into it. It will have the rhythms of the music you have heard, the
> drama of the books you have read, and the tactile influence of all the
> things you have touched.
>
> Sounds like a dream? No way! You have been given all these
> things---these possibilities, and for the small price of a few new
> habits \... who knows?

## Final Words on Essence

> The essence thing appears in all the arts not sketching. In literature
> it is when the writing goes beyond just words---beyond just reporting.
> In music it is when it goes beyond just notes and lyrics---when there
> exists an essence that touches the heart. There are only 26 letters in
> our alphabet---only a couple hundred words we use in daily
> communication, but it is the artful way those are juxtaposed that sets
> them apart as memorable and meaningful. In drawing you have 360
> degrees in which to vary your lines and the choice and variance
> determines whether or not your drawing will be worthy of the effort
> you've spent on it.
>
> There used to be the belief that certain muses attended the
> inspirational needs of the artist. Nowadays we speak of using the
> right side of the brain. Certain metaphysical teachings speak of
> expanded consciousness or awareness.
>
> In Psalm I it says the man whose delight is in the law of the Lord ...
> whatever he does prospers. Whatever---it is a shifting of the mental
> gears from the ordinary to the inspired area of creativity. Here are a
> few bars of Mozart. How can anything so beautiful be put down so
> simply? When it's played by a good pianist it sounds like an ethereal
> orchestra playing God's own Symphony.

> THE ROAD NOT TAKEN

> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both

> As for drawings and sketches that "tell all," they are all around us.
